The process for releasing a new tarball is as follows:

1. make sure you have the latest build requirements installed:

	git://git.freedesktop.org/git/util/macros
	git://git.freedesktop.org/git/util/modular

2. update your module version (usually found in configure.ac)

	$ vi configure.ac # bump version
        $ git push origin # make sure you're on the release branch

3. verify your module builds

	$ make distcheck

4. tag the release

	$ git tag -m "Intel <ver> release" xf86-video-intel-<ver>

5. run the release script (this should push the tag)

	$ <path_to>/util/modular/release.sh driver xf86-video-intel-<last_ver> xf86-video-intel-<ver>

6. edit the generated release message as needed and send it out

	for major releases list added features and known limitations

	for minor releases indicate which bugs were fixed and which
	are still present

7. throw a release party, you're done! :)
