 * It provides a significant set of default window management behaviours that
 * we expect many shells will want to reuse. Surface objects by themselves
 * are designed to be self-contained an unaware of their surroundings, so
 * SurfaceController/Coordinator has an important job to fill in the blanks
 * such as telling a surface how to go full screen, maximize, or (in future)
 * how to snap to an adjacent surface.
 *   SurfaceController must provide all the window management logic that a
 * Surface object by itself can't fulfil.
