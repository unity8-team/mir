# This is the X Strike Force shell library for X Window System package
# maintainer scripts.  It serves to define shell functions commonly used by
# such packages, and performs some error checking necessary for proper operation
# of those functions.  By itself, it does not "do" much; the maintainer scripts
# invoke the functions defined here to accomplish package installation and
# removal tasks.

# If you are reading this within a Debian package maintainer script (e.g.,
# /var/lib/dpkg)info/PACKAGE.{config,preinst,postinst,prerm,postrm}), you can
# skip past this library by scanning forward in this file to the string
# "GOBSTOPPER".
