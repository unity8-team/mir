xserver-xorg-video-intel (2:2.7.0-1ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

  * Merge from Debian of upstream's 2.7.0 release.
    - Fixes: memory leak causes system to run out of memory
      (LP: #360319)
    - Fixes: Video playback suffers from tearing on GMA 4500MHD
      (LP: #339233)
    - Fixes: powertop wakeups 71.6 <interrupt> : i915@pci
      (LP: #352763)
    - Fixes: `man intel` does not mention UXA in the AccelMethod section
      (LP: #364284)
    - Fixes: TV Format changes don't work
      (LP: #298422)
  * Remaining ubuntu changes against Debian version:
    - Add lpia architecture
    - 103_quirk_intel_mb890.patch: quirk
    - 109_i830-fifo-watermark-conservative.patch: Still in progress  
      upstream in fd.o #19304, but retain as a placeholder until better
      fix is found.
    - 110_quirk_hp_mini.patch: quirk
    - 116_8xx_disable_dri.patch: DRI proved buggy on certain 8xx chips so
      this disables it.  The DRI probably needs re-testing to verify this
      patch is still needed, but it will be kept for now.
    - 117_quirk_thinkpad_x30.patch: quirk
    - 119_drm_bo_unreference_needs_null.patch: Fixes several crashes;
      seems not to be included upstream yet.
  * Drop patches no longer needed:
    - Drop 112_num_used_fences.patch; no longer needed with updated kernel
    - Drop 105_no_modesetting.diff; now we want to enable kernel modesetting
    - Drop 115_fix_crash_xv_overlay.patch; included in upstream
    - Drop 118_drop_legacy3d.patch; included in upstream
    - Drop 120_fix_vt_switch.patch; included in upstream
    - Drop 106_remove_triple_buffering.diff; included in upstream
    - Drop 107_remove_pageflipping.diff; included in upstream
  * Refresh 119_drm_bo_unreference_needs_null.patch to apply

xserver-xorg-video-intel (2:2.6.3-0ubuntu7) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Add 119_drm_bo_unreference_needs_null.patch:
    - The first time through the Xv code, an allocated buffer is
      unreferenced but the pointer is not reset to NULL.  Thus, the next time
      a video is played, -intel thinks it has a valid buffer and crashes
      when it tries to access the freed memory.  Fixes a number of crashes
      reported since moving to the 2.6.3 driver.
    - Fixes crash on i945 with frame buffer width > 2048.  DRI is disabled
      on this chipset when the frame buffer exceeds this width.
      (LP: #354688)
    - Fixes crash on i865 where DRI is off because of patch 116
      (LP: #352760)
    - Fixes crash on i845 starting after 304871 was fixed
      (LP: #354889)

      (LP: #304614)
  * Add 118_drop_legacy3d.patch:
    - Remove Legacy3D as a user-configurable option and force fallback to
      legacy fixed textures when GEM is not being used.  Fixes "couldn't
      bind memory for BO backbuffer" issue on at least i855 chipsets.

      as a workaround until a better fix is found.
      (LP: #317457)

    this properly (libdrm2 commit a87c1a081b77a29fe3430d).

    - Various new hw quirks
  * Add ChangeLog not included in upstream tarball (else FTBS)
  * Add 112_num_used_fences.patch: Work around FTBS due to missing kernel
    header changes (from drm commit 0f973f27888e4664b253ab2cf69c67c2eb80ab1b)

        other similar hardware. Fixes issue where X comes up with an
        unusable white screen on the LVDS. (LP: 297245)
  * Add 105_no_modesetting.diff
    - 2.6.28 doesn't ship drm headers that support modesetting, so
      disable it for the driver to build.
  * Add 106_remove_triple_buffering.diff
    - Obsolete code, prerequisite for the next patch.
  * Add 107_remove_pageflipping.diff

      so without this the build fails.

xserver-xorg-video-intel (2:2.4.0-1ubuntu1) intrepid; urgency=low

  * Merge with debian experimental.
  * 20_thinkpad_g40_quirk.patch: don't remove another quirk, must've been
    a mistake (and not related to G40).
  * 21_quirk_lenovo.patch: rename and drop the HP quirk, since it's
    upstream.
  * rules: drop the change to not build intel_reg_dumper, libpciaccess is
    in main now.
  * changelog: bring back old entries lost during an old merge (ahem..).
  * Fixes from upstream 2.4-branch:
    30_update_dsparb.patch
    - Update DSPARB while planes are still off.
    31_reorder_visuals.patch
    - Reorder visuals reported by the intel driver.
    32_dont_program_dsparb.patch
    - Don't program dsparb on new Intel chip.
    33_fix_hp_pavilion_quirk.patch
    - Fix up the HP Pavilion ze4944ea quirk. The chip is 855GM, not GM45.
