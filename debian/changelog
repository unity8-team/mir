  * SwitchingBundle: Simplify and clarify guarantees that
    compositor_acquire always has a buffer to return without blocking or
    throwing an exception. The trade-off is that to enforce the
    guarantee we need to permanently reserve one buffer for compositing.
    This reduces the flexibility of SwitchingBundle a little, such that
    minimum nbuffers is now 2. This was originally requested by
    Alexandros, as the potential throw concerned him. Although, it was
    logically guaranteed to never happen for other reasons. The second
    reason for doing this is to eliminate recycling logic, which while
    safe and correct, was quite confusing. So this change further proves
    that that logic (now removed) is not to blame for frame ordering
    bugs. .

  * Fix server-side tracking of client buffers When the server knows the
    client has a given buffer cached it only needs to send the BufferID
    rather than the full IPC package. While this is an optimisation,
    it's also required for correctness - the client will not clean up
    fds for buffers it has cached, so if the server sends a full IPC
    package for a buffer the client knows about any buffer fds leak. The
    buffer cache is per-surface on the client side, but was per-session
    on the server side. This meant that the server did not accurately
    track the client's buffers, resulting in it sending unexpected fds
    that the client then leaked. Fix this by making the buffer tracker
    per-surface server-side.

mir (0.0.8+13.10.20130809.3-0ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  [ Daniel van Vugt ]
  * Simplify and generalize buffer swapping to support arbitrary numbers
    of: - buffers - compositors - clients This is a unified N-buffers
    algorithm which supports any positive number of buffers, as well as
    dynamically switching between synchronous and asynchronous
    behaviour. So it does everything the existing code does and more.
    The key requirement is to support an arbitrary number of (different)
    simultaneous compositor acquisitions, as is needed for bypass
    support (coming soon). This then leads to the requirement that a
    compositor and a snapshot buffer should be acquired differently.
    Because a snapshot should never consume frames, only observe them.
    On the other hand, a compositior acquire must consume a frame (if
    available) so as to guarantee correct ordering when more than one
    are acquired simultaneously in bypass mode. Also fixes LP: #1199717
    and is half the fix for LP: #1199450. (LP: #1199450, #1199717)

    of the transformation changes. (LP: #1193020) . (LP: #1193020)
  * Don't pass a clang-only option to gcc. It will not understand and
    cause build failure (LP: #1194385). (LP: #1194385)
  * Fix build failure due to differing exception specifiers. noexcept
    destructors should be enforced in derived classes if the base uses
    them. (LP: #1194703). (LP: #1194703)
  * Document thread safety pitfalls about client-side callbacks. .
  * Fix mismatched destructor exception specifiers causing build failure
    in gcc 4.7. Also fix struct/class mismatches that some compilers
    will treat as an error. (LP: #1196415). (LP: #1196415)
  * mir_demo_client_unaccelerated: Add an FPS count, and a "-n" option
    to disable vsync (set swap interval to 0).
  * mir_demo_client_egl*: Add a "-n" option to disable syncing to vblank
    (hence to use swap interval == 0).
  * Initial attempts at making the Mir client API thread safe.
    Ordinarily you would not build locking into an API, however the fact
    that Mir clients implicitly get multiple threads created for them
    makes it important for the API itself to be automatically thread
    safe. I've tried to avoid API changes, but adding a new function:
    mir_wait_for_one was necessary. This is because mir_wait_for doesn't
    work if multiple threads are waiting on the same thing
    simultaneously. And the fact that waiting at all is optional means
    we can't change the behaviour of mir_wait_for -- it must always wait
    for all outstanding results (which is only safe in clients where the
    waiting happens in a single thread). .
  * Work around GCC issue 50043 which is causing build failures on
    raring. (LP: #1199210) The gcc bug is only fixed in 4.8/saucy. (LP:
    #1199210)
  * MockDisplayConfigurationPolicy: Work around gcc-4.7 bugs causing
    build failure on raring. (LP: #1200064). (LP: #1200064)
  * Another workaround for gcc-4.7 bugs causing build failure. (LP:
    #1200107). (LP: #1200107)
  * buffer_swapper_spin.h: Remove dead code: initialize_queues.
  * Remove unused interface surfaces::GraphicRegion It became unused
    when Kevin's work landed in r856 yesterday. .
  * Rename compositor::Renderables --> compositor::Scene What is a
    "Renderables"? It's the interface by which we know the scene graph,
    or the model of how all the surfaces relate to each other. Right,
    then call it a scene graph... but the word "graph" might imply a
    particular structure. And we don't want to imply such things in an
    interface. So just call it "scene". That makes slightly more sense
    than imagining what a "Renderables" (singular) is.
  * Fix comments which mention incorrect namespaces for Buffer following
    yesterday's landings.

  [ Ricardo Mendoza ]
  * Fix broken tests/unit-
    tests/client/android/test_client_android_registrar.cpp due to unused
    return value.

  [ Thomas Voß ]
  * Wait for vt to become active if we need to activate it.
  * Remove disabling asio's epoll reactor implementation from the
    package build flags.
  * Introduce cmake options to be able to selectively switch acceptance,
    integration and unit tests on/off. (LP: #1195265)

  [ Thomi Richards ]
  * Remove workaround for bug #1198022. (LP: #1198022)

  [ Robert Carr ]
  * Add raise method to surface stack.
  * Remove cucumber and all references. (LP: #1194075)
  * Add support for shaped input regions.
  * Store MirMotionAction as integer due to usage of extra bits by
    android input stack. (LP: #1197108)
  * Fix obscurance of touch events according to stacking.
  * Extract DefaultServerConfiguration::the_cursor_listener from
    DefaultServerConfiguration::the_input_configuration. (LP: #1192916)
  * Implement a connection authorization mechanism.
  * Correct test_surface_stack.cpp ordering tests.
  * Move the DepthId in surface creation to
    msh::SurfaceCreationParameters.
