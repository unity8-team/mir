A stand-alone android input stack (EventHub, InputReader, InputChannel, etc) so
that it can be used isolatedly, outside android proper.

All the needed base, helper and utility classes (e.g. String8) were also brought along.

Debugging
=========

Define FAKE_LOG_DEVICE=1 in android/CMakeLists.txt to make log be printed to the stderr.

Set the ANDROID_LOG_TAGS environment variable to "*:v" (make everything verbose).

In the beginning of, say, InputReader.cpp, change the defines you're interesed
in (e.g. DEBUG_RAW_EVENTS) from 0 to 1.
