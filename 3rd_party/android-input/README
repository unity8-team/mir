A stand-alone android input stack (EventHub, InputReader, InputChannel, etc) so
that it can be used isolatedly, outside android proper.

All the needed base, helper and utility classes (e.g. String8) were also brought along.

Subdirectories:
 * android_pristine - The original, unmodified, android files, as they were
                      fetched from android's source tree. Here just as a reference
                      to track the local modifications made. Useful when you want to
                      update the project to the latest android source tree.
 * android - The android files, but with some modifications to work on this
             project. They are the ones that actually get compiled.

We strive to keep a minimal delta between android and android_pristine to make easier
for us to get all updates made by them on the android project. That is, to avoid
forking that code and therefore having to maintain it all ourselves. We just maintain
the delta/modifications instead.

Running
=======

Set the following environment variables to something or any path, otherwise applications
seg fault: ANDROID_ROOT, ANDROID_DATA

Debugging
=========

Define FAKE_LOG_DEVICE=1 in android/CMakeLists.txt to make log be printed to the stderr.

Set the ANDROID_LOG_TAGS environment variable to "*:v" (make everything verbose).

In the beginning of, say, InputReader.cpp, change the defines you're interesed
in (e.g. DEBUG_RAW_EVENTS) from 0 to 1.
