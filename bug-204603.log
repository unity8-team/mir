    xvmc: consolidate put surface interfaces
    
    Make surface list track like context list, and move
    generic PutSurface code out of i915. So MC driver just
    needs to fill specific the command params, and we can
    get one single type of intel xvmc command to issue,
    ddx driver's put_image_size got removed.
    
    Fix last commit with missing XvMCContext assignment.

    Unconditionally restore pipe configuration
    
    This is a partial fix for #13196, which covers both leaving pipes disabled at
    server exit time and problems with restoring the pipe configuration on certain
    chipsets.  It restores the pipe configuration unconditionally (previously we
    made sure the PLL was running and we weren't in VGA mode) but also adds some
    additional PLL settle time to the PLL register write paths.

    Fix backlight setting save/restore
    
    We need to save the current backlight value at LVDS init time, as well as when
    we change the DPMS setting.  Also, since 0 is a valid backlight value, don't
    set the backlight value to maximum at startup if the value happens to be zero.
    
    These fixes should make the backlight user experience much more consistent and
    hopefully less frustrating.

    The PLL spreadsheet makes the precise register ranges allowed for each mode

    the gap we've seen in the reachable frequencies.

    Improve backlight control
    
    This commit fixes backlight support for several platforms.
    
    Except on recent machines supporting the IGD OpRegion specification,
    backlight control is rather platform specific.  In some cases, we can
    program the native backlight control regsiters directly without any
    trouble.  On others, we need to use the legacy backlight control
    register.  On still others, we need a combination of the two.  And on
    some platforms, none of the above will work, so we go through the
    kernel backlight interface, which provides a platform specific driver
    for backlight control.

    In the clock graph, draw the VCO as erasures in the lines representing clocks.
    
    This shows one of the reasons for the gaps: with the other settings, the VCO
    is too low inside the gap.  However, it also points out another issue: we
    aren't using the high end of the VCO range due to some other limits being hit.

    When restoring the palette, we weren't checking to make sure the

    palette save/restore and verify that the pipes are on before we touch
    the registers (could easily be changed to enable/disable the pipes
    around the save/restore as well).

    Move tiling fence register setup to bind time instead of allocate time.
    
    This allows us to allocate tiled buffers in buffer objects.  In the process
    I removed the fence division that we had for tiled buffers on pre-965.  If we
    resurrect that code, it should probably be managed by just dividing all the
    objects in roughly half and fencing those halves (to reduce the alignment
    requirement), instead of using giant fences until we run out of space and then
    trying to deal with scarce space on the last (or not) buffer.  Halving
    our tiled objects would use 6/8 of our fence registers on that hardware.

    Rework DRI buffer mappings and sarea setup to allow for moving buffers.
    
    While this has been a desired feature for some time, to allow for reallocation
    of the front buffer, it was made more necessary by the desire to avoid
    requiring a NO_MOVE buffer type in TTM because buffer objects may not be left
    pinned over VT switch.  This is a step towards making those buffers
    movable and resizable.

    Move drmMMLock to after we have unbound our (pinned) buffers.
    
    There are still issues due to the fact that we're allocating

    we have no way of pinning it back in the same location.

    Fix probing of the sample CH7017 device I found by allowing GPIO overrides.
    
    It may be that the LVDS chips need to be DVOA and GPIOB only on mobility
    devices with them, and DVOC/GPIOE on non-mobility like this 845.  But until
    more examples are found, just make this one device probe.

    Merge branch 'buffer-objects'
    
    This branch changes i830_memory.c's allocator to use TTM when available to
    allocate memory, which also allows TTM to control almost the entire aperture.
    As a result, our front/back/depth buffers are created as real buffer objects,
    which may be used by the DRI driver instead of the fake buffer type in TTM.
    The updated DRM with bo_set_pin ioctl is required, to allow us to pin and
    unpin our buffers as needed.

    Only swap planes and pipes if DRM supports it
    
    We want to associate plane A with pipe B on pre-965 mobile chips, since that's
    the only way to get framebuffer compression on the builtin LVDS on those
    platforms.  However, if we do this swapping and DRM isn't aware of it, we may
    end up requesting vblank events for the wrong pipe, or setting up SAREA buffer
    swap state incorrectly.
    
    This mod checks whether DRM supports the new plane->pipe swapping behavior, and
    only enables the swapping if so.  This should fix the bugs Lukas found and
    debugged.  Reviewed by Michel Danzer.

    Disambiguate plane and pipe mapping, use plane A on pipe B on pre-965 LVDS
    
    Add a new 'plane' field to the intel_crtc private structure for tracking
    planes separate from pipes.  This allows pre-965 chips to use plane A
    on pipe B, enabling framebuffer compression for builtin LVDS displays.

    Tiling fixes for 965
    
    This should be close to the last set of tiling fixes for 965 chipsets.
    Prior to this commit, the 965 composite hook didn't take tiling into
    account, nor did 965 textured video, which caused display corruption.
    However, there seems to be at least one last bug to squash--on occasion,
    a configuration with tiling enabled won't properly display text.  This
    is likely another tiling related problem with the composite hook.

    Fix EXA rendering with tiled front buffer on pre-965.
    
    The 915 and earlier appear to respect the fence registers, while only the 965
    requires the per-operation tiling setting and pitch shifting.  This will also
    fix issues with rendering on the 965 involving multiple cliprects, where the
    pitch would get divided repeatedly.
    
    This removes the offset < 4096 fallback, which essentially resulted in no
    acceleration to tiled buffers, hiding the issues.

    Use new drmBOSetPin interface instead of NO_EVICT/NO_MOVE buffers.
    
    To do this, we have to deal with buffer offsets being set at EnterVT time
    instead of screen init time. We've wanted to move this direction for a long
    time, but there are repercussions.  The EXA offscreen memory manager has to
    be disabled, because it can't be moved.  That will be replaced by BO-backed
    pixmaps soon.  Also unresolved is whether our moving
    front/back/depth/texture buffers will break the classic-mode DRI driver.
    
    This code doesn't actually work yet.

    When TTM is available, use it instead of manual AGP allocations when possible.
    
    This is a step towards being able to expose buffer objects through the screen
    private to DRI clients, instead of having them have to use the fake buffer
    object type.
    
    This fails in two ways.  First, the kernel memory manager is not currently
    suitable for doing the physical allocations we need, so we still use AGP for
    those.  Additionally, the DRI lock can't be initialized early enough for us, so
    these buffer object allocations fail.  This will be fixed by improving the
    DRM interface.
