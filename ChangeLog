    Only allocate pixmaps aligned for tiling when requested by DRI2 GetBuffers.
    
    This saves massive quantities of memory on pre-965 since the DRI2 tiling
    enable caused the minimum size of any pixmap to be 1MB.

    Set alignments, tile settings and flags correctly in the 2D driver to support
    tiled rendering.  UXA's create pixmap function currently assumes the worst
    about the alignment constraints; that should probably be fixed.  Some of the
    1M alignment fixes could probably be done more cleanly as well.

    Fixup bogus VBT modes when detected
    
    Several VBT modes out in the wild have H or VSyncEnd values greater than

    The require_space had failed since it only checked for the space required

    i965_emit_composite_state() that it called (the state we were concerned about
    having set up for that 12 * 4 dwords to follow!).  This is replaced by
    intel_batch_start_atomic(), which will catch such mistakes in the future.

    Assign rotation memory dri_bo to rotation pixmap.
    
    As the rotation memory and rotation pixmap are allocated separately (to make
    rotation at startup work), the allocate dri_bo needs to be set in the pixmap
    for acceleration to work. This restores the performance in rotated modes.

    Make i830_allocate_memory take tiling parameters.
    
    This eliminates the separate i830_allocate_memory_tiled function which means
    that all memory objects will have tiling parameters set correctly.

    Remove logical context setup.
    
    This should be a noop.  If it wasn't a noop, it means that on pre-g33 chipsets
    we were spamming some data into a page of system memory because we used a
    virtual instead of a physical address.  It was also supposed to not work when
    we submit it from a batchbuffer, as we have been doing for some time now.
    This code has existed since about the beginning of the driver's existence,
    with no justification.

    Don't run in KD_TEXT mode even with KMS
    
    Leaving the VT in KD_TEXT mode keeps the kernel's blanking code active,
    so when a DPMS event happens, the fb console is restored rather than X's
    configuration.  On the downside it means the kernel won't print messages
    in the background, which would be visible if a panic or emergency switch
    occurred.  The proper fix here is a new kernel mode, which we can move
    to when ready.

    This also introduces tests to make sure that we asked for enough reserved space

    but could potentially affect text rendering with GEM in general with an
    exceptional batchbuffer setup.

    Assign rotation memory dri_bo to rotation pixmap.
    
    As the rotation memory and rotation pixmap are allocated separately (to make
    rotation at startup work), the allocate dri_bo needs to be set in the pixmap
    for acceleration to work. This restores the performance in rotated modes.

    If the EDID data from the LVDS doesn't indicate support for a wide range of
    continuous frequencies, it will not match any of the default modes although
    our LVDS scaler logic ignores refresh rates when programming LVDS modes. Fix
    this by smashing the compute EDID data to open up the sync rates.

    This fixes glReadPixels failure on single-channel 915GM, as the software code

    these buffers (everything else says "rely on fence registers", since the 2D
    blits don't have a "don't rely on fence registers" option).

    uxa: Do a hack to use the aperture mapping instead of bo_map in sw fallbacks.
    
    Because of how fallbacky the uxa rendering core is, and our inability (without
    wfb in userland or page faulting in the kernel) to tell the kernel just where
    we're going to fall back, the clflush overhead can become outrageous, for
    example with emacs and xcompmgr.  Instead of using drm_intel_bo_map, pin the
    buffer and do the fallback to the aperture mapping.  This gets us the bad old
    performance that fb is designed for, instead of bad new performance.

    interlaced mode based on CEA_861B, but currently we
    don't support interlaced mode. So it should be set as 0.

    Which is just being tidy. We initially were looking at this code
    path due to a report of a crash on server shutdown which started
    after this unreference call was added. Setting this to NULL
    apparently didn't avoid the crash, but it's a good thing to do
    regardless.

    Don't smash fixed_mode if skip_panel_detect is set.
    
    Without this change, setting LVDSFixedMode to false is not effective
    as i830_bios_init calls i830_parse_panel_data which in turns sets
    a fixed_mode. To fix this we still call parse_panel_data to set
    the various lvds_options but we return before setting fixed_mode.

    i965: Add batch_flush_notify hook to create new vertex-buffer bo
    
    This avoids mapping a buffer object which is being referenced
    by a batch that has already been flushed, (which is a terribly
    expensive operation).
    
    On my machine this brings the performance of x11perf -aa10text
    from 85k back to 150k, (where it was before a recent kernel
    upgrade). Also, before this patch, when I used my X server
    actively performance would drop as low as 15k---hopefully that
    bug is gone with this change.

    This was an early attempt to support display switch hotkey.  It never really
    worked, as the events didn't show up when they should.  It also cost a wakeup
    every second to check just in case, instead of taking an interrupt like we can
    now using ACPI.  Additionally, some machines apparently get stuck with the
    event set and end up DDCing checking for new devices every second and
    smashing your video modes.

    Use buffer objects for binding table and surface-state objects.
    
    Instead of having a static array for these and doing an ugly sync
    everytime we recycle the array, we now simply allocate short-lived
    buffer objects for this dynamic state. The dri layer, in turn, can
    take care of efficiently reusing objects as necessary.
    
    On a GM965 this change was tested to improve the performance of
    x11perf -aa10text from roughly 120000 to 154000 glyphs/sec.

    it for our vertex buffer).

    965: Move composite setup to new _emit_batch_header_for_composite
    
    This function is the new name for _allocate_dynamic_state now that
    it also emits everything to the batch necessary for setting up a
    composite operation. This happens in prepare_composite() every
    time and in composite() whenever our vertex buffer fills up.
    
    It's not yet strictly necessary to be redoing this setup in
    composite() but it will be soon when the setup starts referring
    to buffer objects for surface state and binding table. This
    move prepares for that.

    Use buffer object for vertex buffer (in new gen4_dynamic_state)
    
    This begins the process of separating the dynamic data from the
    static data, (still to move are the surface state and binding
    table objects). The new dynamic_state is stored in a buffer
    object, so this patch restores the buffer-object-for-vertex-buffer
    functionality originally in commit 1abf4d3a7a and later reverted
    in 5c9a62a29f.
    
    A notable difference is that this time we actually do use
    check_aperture_space to ensure things will fit, (assuming
    there's a non-empty implementation under that).

    Rename gen4_state_init to gen4_static_state_init

    Also we make things less muddled by having this function

    than a gen4_state_t, (and then fetching the desired pointer
    out from that).
    
    Again, no intended change in functionality here.

    Rename gen4_state_t to gen4_static_state_t
    
    It doesn't contain only static data yet, but it will soon, so
    this renaming prepares for that. Also, this helps make things
    more clear between gen4_render_state_t and gen4_state_t which
    were muddled before, (particularly because the corresponding
    identifiers were render_state and card_state). The card_state
    identifier is now known as static_state which should be less
    confusing.
    
    This change is strictly search-and-replace with no functional
    changes.

    Fix broken stolen memory counting on G4X.
    
    On the GM45 we were assuming too little stolen memory (mostly harmless,
    except when it wasn't, until the AGP fix), and on the G45 we were assuming too
    much stolen memory, which was quite harmful when we touched the page that
    didn't get mapped.
    
    Future stolen memory accounting should use src/reg_dumper/intel_gtt before and
    after enabling AGP on the chipset to confirm that only the GTT entries not
    mapped to stolen are replaced, and that all of the unmapped GTT entries are
    replaced with the constant scratch page.

    Bug #17892: Fix possible crash in CRT probe
    
    Introduced in patch for DVI-I CRT probe, if no EDID
    CRT monitor is connected, origin code destroys default
    DDC bus which causes crash in later get_modes call.
    Change it to setup and destroy DDC bus as needed in
    get_modes, so we always reprobe and get current state.

    For non-DRM, add NOOPs after BATCH_BUFFER_START to verify completion
    
    In non-DRM mode, the driver waits for the hardware by checking the ring
    pointers; when the ring is empty, it assumes the hardware is idle. However,
    the hardware updates the ring pointers before executing a command, so if the
    MI_BATCH_BUFFER_START is the last command in the ring, the driver will think
    the hardware is idle while it may still be processing the contents of the
    batch buffer. Placing NOOPs after the BATCH_BUFFER_START allows the driver
    to know that the hardware has completed the batch buffer.

    Disable frame buffer compression by default for GM965.
    
    We haven't found a way to make FBC work reliably with GM965 yet,
    (it often fails to notice CPU writes). This appears to be a
    specific problem with this device, (as we haven't gotten similar
    bug reports for subsequent devices such as GM45). So FBC is
    now disabled by default for GM965 but can still be enabled with
    the FrameBufferCompression option for experimenting/debugging.

    Fallback to software for RepeatNone with transformed RGB-only pictures.
    
    We wish it wouldn't, but the hardware ignores the alpha in the
    BorderColor we set when the source picture format has no alpha
    in it, (and it uses alpha of 1.0 where we want 0.0). For now,
    fallback for these cases. This gives a correct result, but
    obviously is not as fast as we would like.

    Prefer repeatType field over using both repeat and repeatType.
    
    Eric informed me that the repeat field exists only for backwards
    compatibility with old drivers that weren't prepared for values
    other than 0 or 1 here. Since we are, we can just ignore that
    field and examine only repeatType. So the code's a (tiny) bit
    simpler this way.

    Add support for RepeatPad and RepeatReflect.
    
    It's quite simple to support these modes---we simply need to
    turn on the support for them in the hardware.
    
    These changes have been verified with the extend-pad and
    extend-reflect tests in cairo's test suite. However, this
    currently required using a custom-modified version of cairo.
    The issue is that released versions of cairo, (and even
    cairo master so far), don't pass RepeatPad and RepeatReflect
    to Render, (due to various bugs and workarounds in cairo
    and pixman). I do plan to fix those issues in cairo, so that
    in a future release of cairo, (1.8.2 perhaps?), the cairo
    test suite will usefully test these new repeat modes in our
    driver.

    Examine picture repeatType as well as repeat field.
    
    The existing switch statement was switching on the Boolean
    repeat field rather than the correct repeatType field. This
    had not caused any problem before as only two possible repeat
    values were supported (RepeatNone = 0 and RepeatNormal = 1)
    so they were always the same as the repeat field.
    
    Soon, however, we'll be supporting more repeat types, so we'll
    need to switch on the correct value.

    Bug #17277: fix upscaling limit
    
    Oh duh (i830_video.c):
    
            /* Clamp dst width & height to 7x of src (overlay limit) */
            if(drw_w > (src_w * 7))
                drw_w = src_w * 7;
    
    	if(drw_h > (src_h * 7))
                drw_h = src_h * 7;
    
    The condition I see in the documentation appears to be src_h/drw_h < 8, that
    is, src_h < 8*drw_h.  It appears this was "fixed" incorrectly in e784e152.
    It seems difficult to believe that this limitation would exist at all for the
    texture unit.

    The regs are undocumented, but on some machines they work fine, so add this
    quirk to indicate it.

    [PATCH] avoid duplicate mode set in lvds
    
    xf86SetDesiredModes() already sets lvds to full mode. later when
    xf86CrtcScreenInit() initialized randr12, i830_lvds_set_property will
    recall xf86CrtcSetMode and set mode to full. This patch is to remove the
    duplication. In my test, this can save about 0.2 - 0.4s x startup time.

    EXA and UXA have the same acceleration interface, but UXA doesn't provide

    reference the EXA structure.

    The root window visual can not be changed. Neither at runtime nor
    through the configuration file. The xserver simply selects the first one
    that matches the class (usually TrueColor). I need a root window visual
    with stencil buffer because my compiz plugin uses the it for some
    operations. This patch reorders the visuals that the 3D driver reports
    and puts the one with stencil (and depth) bits as first.

    on the relative HDisplay of the modes.  This should resolve some fifo underrun
    issues with differently-sized displays, or single large ones.

    Get HDMI output working.
    
    HDMI, despite claiming to have pixel multiply support, actually doesn't
    want it, at least in the way that SDVO did.  Disable it.
    
    Also disable the NULL_PACKETS_DURING_VSYNC bit.  Despite the docs telling us
    to set it, the output doesn't like it when you do that, and the BIOS doesn't
    set it.
    
    Also add a posting read to SDVOx setting.  Without it, half the X starts
    wouldn't get anything on the screen.  (interestingly, it was every other
    startup, not just a chance).

    Use the DRM for submitting batchbuffers when available.
    
    There are some concerns with this, as the DRM will be setting the nonsecure
    flag on the batchbuffer, and the server may be submitting some secure-only
    commands.  It appears to work on the 915GM test system currently.

    Avoid needless flush emits in the blockhandler.
    
    The EmitFlush in i830_dri.c was added as a pageflipping workaround, and was
    noted to not even be sufficient then.  There's no reason for it to be there,
    so it's removed.  After that, we just have to not emit an MI_FLUSH if we
    already had, and cursor movement no longer bashes memory manager.

    If you want this workaround for the original bug exposed when moving to

    It turns out 855 has a different DSPARB layout than 915+.  And 945+ have more
    FIFO entries, so we have to allocate things differently.  So on 855 split the
    FIFO evenly again between A & B planes, and do the same on 945, where we have a
    larger FIFO.  Fixes an issue reported by Daniel Stone with the previous default
    value.

    Panel fitting:  fix letterbox modes
    
    In full_aspect mode, we try to preserve the aspect ratio by adding
    either top & bottom or left & right borders.  In the letterbox case (top
    & bottom borders) we were miscalculating the top border which led to
    programming a bad mode.  Fix the calculation and bug #15559.

    Implement option to ignore external fixed mode settings
    
    The Intel xorg driver tries mightily to determine the native fixed
    panel mode settings for the LVDS output.  It does this through various
    means, including scanning video BIOS tables, and noticing if the pipe
    in question has already been set up by somebody else (and adopting
    those timings).  This strategy works well for say a laptop where the
    LCD panel is an integral part of the machine.  But for other
    applications where the display is unrelated to the system's BIOS or
    other software, then the BIOS will likely have no clue how to
    configure the LVDS output.  Worse still, the BIOS can simply "get it
    wrong", leaving the pipe misconfigured.  Unfortunately the Intel
    driver can potentially notice this, adopt the same settings, leaving a
    messed up display.
    
    All of this complexity normally happens independently, behind the
    scenes, from the mode timings that might otherwise be specified by the
    user.  This driver has a concept of fixed, i.e. "native" mode, and
    then user-specified mode.  If the corresponding resolutions between
    those concepts don't match, then the driver in theory will arrange for
    scaling to take place while adhering to the actual native mode of the
    panel.  Said another way, if the user says 800x600 but the driver
    mistakenly (see above) thinks the native mode is 640x480, then 640x480
    is the mode set with scaling to an 800x600 frame buffer.  If the
    driver gets the wrong native mode, then the result is a miserable mess
    with no way for the user to override what the driver thinks is right.
    
    This patch provides a means to override the driver.  This implements a
    new driver option, "LVDSFixedMode" which defaults to true (the normal,
    probe-what-I-need behavior).  However when set to false, then all the
    guessing is skipped and the driver will assume no fixed, i.e. "native"
    mode for the display device.  Instead with this option set to false,
    the driver will directly set the timings specified by the user,
    providing an escape hatch for situations where the driver can't
    correctly figure out the right mode.
    
    Under most scenarios of course, this option should not be needed.  But
    in situations where the Intel video BIOS is hopelessly fouled up
    related to the LVDS output, this option provides the escape hatch for
    the user to get a working display in spite of the BIOS situation.

    Add a new quirk for BIOSes that reprogram regs at lid close/open time
    
    Dell Latitude D500s seem to have this problem.  At lid close/open, the DSPABASE
    reg gets reset to 0, so we either need to keep the framebuffer at offset 0 or
    make sure we reprogram the CRTCs after the lid opens again.  Since we can't
    make sure the former is always true (buffer resize, etc.), this patch adds a
    quirk to reset the modes at lid open time.

    Kludge to make planar video work - duplicate sampler state
    
    This patch duplicates all of the surface sampler state needed to read from
    the separate YUV surfaces and then has the planar sampler read from samplers
    0, 2, 4 instead of 0, 1, 2. This appears to make things work, instead of
    having the samplers break at random. I do not understand why this works.

    Revert "Compute pixel values directly into data port"
    
    This reverts commit 346cf57deabb4c336612df4c13650a87b5ef6775.
    
    Mixing randr transforms and video caused screen corruption for Render
    operations. No, I don't understand why.

    Remove sync after 965 video put.
    
    The hardware has been marked as needing a sync, so the next video put will
    block waiting for the previous one to complete. Adding a sync here just
    stalls the video playback for no good reason.

    Compute pixel values directly into data port
    
    Instead of leaving pixel values in src_sample registers, compute the pixel
    values directl to the data port to save 8 moves. This cannot work when no
    computation is done as there is both no way to wait for the sampler to
    finish and because the sampler returns data in a different order from that
    required by the data port (sigh).

    Implement support for 24 bit pixel format
    
    The Intel driver appears to be coded to only work with displays
    expecting 18 bit pixels.  However I have an application using a LCD
    display that expects pixel data in 24 bit format.  The difference is
    only 2 bits in a single GPU register.  This patch implements that
    change, controlled by a new driver option, "LVDS24Bit".  The default
    value is false, which is the previous behavior.  When set to true,
    then 24 bit panels should work (at least the one I'm testing here
    does).

    SDVO: Fix mixups with input and output channels.
    
    The 2-bit input_mask was actually an input count -- in0 is always there, and
    in1 is optional.
    
    The output flags weren't being reported in the log, so I mistakenly took
    controlled_output == RGB0 to mean that the device only reported an RGB0,
    while it actually reported RGB0|SVID0|YPRPB0|misc|other.  Move SVID0 up
    in priority and remove the RGB-is-it-really-TV hack I had just come up with.
    
    Finally, set the input/output mapping at mode set time.  We're always
    supposed to do this, but haven't had to so far as we've never handled
    devices with more than one output.

    Use combo backlight control rather than pure legacy
    
    If the legacy bit is set, use both the BLC_PWM_CTL and LBB regs to control the
    backlight, rather than just LBB.  Looks like more platforms want that than what
    the current code does.  Note that kernel provided interfaces will always be
    used if available, so this shouldn't affect users with /sys/class/backlight
    interfaces at all.
    
    Fixes #14721.

    Fix 965+ rendering issues with DRI disabled.
    
    The new chips no longer automatically flush the rendering cache, so if we
    don't flush the RC at blockhandler, the last rendering done may not
    appear on the screen.  This was particularly noticable with a bare Xorg with
    some missing root weave, and terminals where the last character wouldn't
    appear until the cursor blinked.  A flush in the DRI blockhandler path had
    hidden this issue for most people.

    Handle projective transforms on 9xx for Composite.
    
    Projective transforms require un-normalized texture coordinates and the use
    of the texldp instruction. The coordinates are passed as x/y/z/w (the z is
    unused, but there isn't a vertext format for just x/y/w).

    When we have unset channels (color for a8, or alpha for x8*), force them
    to the appropriate value in the texture combiner rather than relying on getting
    the desired results from teture mapping.  Performance is the same on 865, so
    multiple paths aren't necessary and we can use the less friendly texture
    formats everywhere.

    This fixed the crash appearing for Xv buffer memory, which appears

    we might get fault that stolen memory protect reverted to non-r/w

    do two BEGIN_LP_RING()s in a single function.  Potential minor performance
    loss isn't too exciting, as ring access is about to become a compat path
    anyway.  This change also removes the requirement for ring emits to be aligned
    to dwords.

    Silence warnings about possible uninitialize use of dst_format.
    
    Whoa, gcc got a lot smarter about warnings.  If iXXX_get_dest_format()
    doesn't support the picture format passed in it won't initialize the
    uint32_t pointed to by dst_format and return FALSE.
    
    What gcc now can detect is if dst_format is used without checking the
    return value, it might be used uninitialized.  This patch makes sure
    we always check the return value before using dst_format.

    Use the "immediate idle" mode for FBC.  Rather than waiting for the current

    idle right away.

    X fails to start without an xorg.conf on i810, because the default depth set by
    the server (32) is not supported by the driver.  I think the driver should
    default to 16 bits (it supports 24, but when I tested it that didn't seem to
    work very well, and dri is disabled at 24 bits depth anyway) instead of letting
    the server use 32 and failing later on.

    Turn on backlight when LVDS panel is powered up
    
    In some configurations, the LVDS may be off at startup along with the
    backlight.  So when turning the LVDS on for the first time, we may also need to
    set the backlight to a non-zero value.  So try to use the saved value if
    possible, but if it's zero, make the backlight full brightness when turning on
    the LVDS.
    
    Note that this is slightly sub-optimal for configurations where zero is a valid backlight brightness.

    Add pipe A force enable quirk
    
    On some platforms, the firmware may read & write GPU registers on lid close,
    suspend/resume time or during various SMM events.  If one of the graphics pipes
    is disabled at that time, the GPU may hang due to the programming dependencies
    of the various registers.
    
    This patch adds a quirk to force the driver to keep pipe A enabled if
    necessary, through user configuration in xorg.conf or via a platform specific
    quirk.  Leaving the pipe enabled comes at a power cost however, so the quirk
    should only be enabled when strictly necessary.
    
    Fixes https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11432.

    Don't modify low bit of BLC_PWM_CTL when using combo backlight control
    
    On some platforms, the low bit of BLC_PWM_CTL is wired as a 'max brightness'
    flag, rather than a regular part of the backlight duty cycle.  So when in the
    combo mode, divide the total number of backlight levels available by two
    (tossing one bit) and adjust the programming in the set_brightness routine.
    
    Note that platforms with this behavior may need quirks added so that they work
    by default.

    Fix compilation error when not using DRI
    
    This patch complements 88f8b688e2316ae4a1f7485f0010ce90de54783a which

    definition.
    
    When XF86DRI and _XF86DRI_SERVER_ are defined this header gets
    indirectly included through "i830_dri.h", thanks to "i830_common.h"
    which masquerades this problem as released in 2.1.0 and that manifests

    xvmc: consolidate put surface interfaces
    
    Make surface list track like context list, and move
    generic PutSurface code out of i915. So MC driver just
    needs to fill specific the command params, and we can
    get one single type of intel xvmc command to issue,
    ddx driver's put_image_size got removed.

    Unconditionally restore pipe configuration
    
    This is a partial fix for #13196, which covers both leaving pipes disabled at
    server exit time and problems with restoring the pipe configuration on certain
    chipsets.  It restores the pipe configuration unconditionally (previously we
    made sure the PLL was running and we weren't in VGA mode) but also adds some
    additional PLL settle time to the PLL register write paths.

    Fix backlight setting save/restore
    
    We need to save the current backlight value at LVDS init time, as well as when
    we change the DPMS setting.  Also, since 0 is a valid backlight value, don't
    set the backlight value to maximum at startup if the value happens to be zero.
    
    These fixes should make the backlight user experience much more consistent and
    hopefully less frustrating.

    The PLL spreadsheet makes the precise register ranges allowed for each mode

    Improve backlight control
    
    This commit fixes backlight support for several platforms.
    
    Except on recent machines supporting the IGD OpRegion specification,
    backlight control is rather platform specific.  In some cases, we can
    program the native backlight control regsiters directly without any
    trouble.  On others, we need to use the legacy backlight control
    register.  On still others, we need a combination of the two.  And on
    some platforms, none of the above will work, so we go through the
    kernel backlight interface, which provides a platform specific driver
    for backlight control.

    This shows one of the reasons for the gaps: with the other settings, the VCO

    aren't using the high end of the VCO range due to some other limits being hit.

    When restoring the palette, we weren't checking to make sure the

    palette save/restore and verify that the pipes are on before we touch
    the registers (could easily be changed to enable/disable the pipes
    around the save/restore as well).

    Move tiling fence register setup to bind time instead of allocate time.
    
    This allows us to allocate tiled buffers in buffer objects.  In the process
    I removed the fence division that we had for tiled buffers on pre-965.  If we
    resurrect that code, it should probably be managed by just dividing all the
    objects in roughly half and fencing those halves (to reduce the alignment
    requirement), instead of using giant fences until we run out of space and then
    trying to deal with scarce space on the last (or not) buffer.  Halving
    our tiled objects would use 6/8 of our fence registers on that hardware.

    Rework DRI buffer mappings and sarea setup to allow for moving buffers.
    
    While this has been a desired feature for some time, to allow for reallocation
    of the front buffer, it was made more necessary by the desire to avoid
    requiring a NO_MOVE buffer type in TTM because buffer objects may not be left
    pinned over VT switch.  This is a step towards making those buffers
    movable and resizable.

    Move drmMMLock to after we have unbound our (pinned) buffers.
    
    There are still issues due to the fact that we're allocating
    NEED_LIFETIME_FIXED memory as buffer objects, which we refuse to unpin because
    we have no way of pinning it back in the same location.

    Fix probing of the sample CH7017 device I found by allowing GPIO overrides.
    
    It may be that the LVDS chips need to be DVOA and GPIOB only on mobility
    devices with them, and DVOC/GPIOE on non-mobility like this 845.  But until
    more examples are found, just make this one device probe.

    Merge branch 'buffer-objects'
    
    This branch changes i830_memory.c's allocator to use TTM when available to
    allocate memory, which also allows TTM to control almost the entire aperture.
    As a result, our front/back/depth buffers are created as real buffer objects,
    which may be used by the DRI driver instead of the fake buffer type in TTM.
    The updated DRM with bo_set_pin ioctl is required, to allow us to pin and
    unpin our buffers as needed.

    Only swap planes and pipes if DRM supports it
    
    We want to associate plane A with pipe B on pre-965 mobile chips, since that's
    the only way to get framebuffer compression on the builtin LVDS on those
    platforms.  However, if we do this swapping and DRM isn't aware of it, we may
    end up requesting vblank events for the wrong pipe, or setting up SAREA buffer
    swap state incorrectly.
    
    This mod checks whether DRM supports the new plane->pipe swapping behavior, and
    only enables the swapping if so.  This should fix the bugs Lukas found and
    debugged.  Reviewed by Michel Danzer.

    on pipe B, enabling framebuffer compression for builtin LVDS displays.

    Tiling fixes for 965
    
    This should be close to the last set of tiling fixes for 965 chipsets.
    Prior to this commit, the 965 composite hook didn't take tiling into
    account, nor did 965 textured video, which caused display corruption.
    However, there seems to be at least one last bug to squash--on occasion,
    a configuration with tiling enabled won't properly display text.  This
    is likely another tiling related problem with the composite hook.

    Fix EXA rendering with tiled front buffer on pre-965.
    
    The 915 and earlier appear to respect the fence registers, while only the 965
    requires the per-operation tiling setting and pitch shifting.  This will also
    fix issues with rendering on the 965 involving multiple cliprects, where the
    pitch would get divided repeatedly.
    
    This removes the offset < 4096 fallback, which essentially resulted in no
    acceleration to tiled buffers, hiding the issues.

    Use new drmBOSetPin interface instead of NO_EVICT/NO_MOVE buffers.
    
    To do this, we have to deal with buffer offsets being set at EnterVT time
    instead of screen init time. We've wanted to move this direction for a long
    time, but there are repercussions.  The EXA offscreen memory manager has to
    be disabled, because it can't be moved.  That will be replaced by BO-backed
    pixmaps soon.  Also unresolved is whether our moving
    front/back/depth/texture buffers will break the classic-mode DRI driver.
    
    This code doesn't actually work yet.

    When TTM is available, use it instead of manual AGP allocations when possible.
    
    This is a step towards being able to expose buffer objects through the screen
    private to DRI clients, instead of having them have to use the fake buffer
    object type.
    
    This fails in two ways.  First, the kernel memory manager is not currently
    suitable for doing the physical allocations we need, so we still use AGP for
    those.  Additionally, the DRI lock can't be initialized early enough for us, so
    these buffer object allocations fail.  This will be fixed by improving the
    DRM interface.

    Remove hard-coded CRT blanking frobbing for load detection.
    
    CRT blanking needn't be adjusted to perform load detection on 9xx chips, and
    the 8xx load detection path now adjusts blanking just during load detection.
    Adjusting the blanking interval turned out to cause many monitors to fail to
    sync.

    Ensure pipe/output active before doing load detection.
    
    If the pipe or output have been set to DPMSOff, then load detection will not
    work correctly. Also, share the load detection configuration code between
    crt and tv outputs.

    Eliminate bogus (and harmful) blanking adjustment for load detect.
    
    Instead of always adding blanking to mode lines, use the FORCE_BORDER option
    on i9xx hardware where it works, and dynamically add a bit of border if
    necessary on i8xx hardware to make load detection work. This may cause
    flashing when a usable crtc is not otherwise idle when load detection is
    requested.

    addresses on these should be for FBC, though, and FBC requires addresses
    below 4GB.  This is unresolved.

    Make sure there is some border area to use by changing how the pipe is
    configured, then pick a scanline in the middle of the border for load
    detection. This lets the load detect code use an active pipe instead of
    requiring an idle one.

    Increase vblank wait timeout from 20ms to 30ms. 49.6Hz < 20ms.
    
    The x40 LVDS mode has a 49.6Hz vertical refresh. Waiting for only 20ms can
    sometimes cause the driver to start programming the hardware before the
    vblank has occurred, which will lock up the i855 chipset. Extend this to
    30ms (the maximum timeout used by the BIOS) to ensure this doesn't happen.
    
    Detecting actual vblank occurance using the various status registers should
    also be possible but isn't yet working.

    current value from the BLC_PWM_CTL register.

    Fix context switching between DRI and X.
    
    Now, all 3D pipeline consumers in the driver just call
    IntelEmitInvariantState(), which handles basic state setup, the caching of that
    state setup, and notifying DRI clients.  This also removes a mistaken idle
    wait in the Render code which was papering over the brokenness in the context
    switching.

    On i830, Pipe B cannot be lit the first time unless Pipe A is running.
    
    I don't understand it, but just like the video overlay, if Pipe A is not
    running, Pipe B will not turn the first time it is activated. This
    patch restructures the code used for the video overlay to share it
    with the crtc commit function.

    The overlay on the i830 appears to be clocked by Pipe A when being enabled.

    Setting a random mode on the Pipe and turning it on fixes this problem
    nicely.

    Deal with i830 CRT load detection which cannot use FORCE_BORDER.
    
    Chips newer than the i830 can force the border color for the active period
    of the screen, allowing the load detection to easily see the right data. In
    addition, newer chips appear to have more sensible load detection hardware
    which either ignores inactive periods on the screen or performs some
    longer-term averaging. The i830 appears to provide unfiltered samples of the
    detected load.
    
    For the i830, then, emit a border at the bottom of the screen and, for load
    detection, simply turn it purple and wait for the current line to be within
    the border. Sample an entire scanline, counting the number of times the load
    detection sees a monitor. In my testing, the presence of a monitor will
    cause the detection to succeed every time, while the absense will cause it
    to fail about 75% of the time. The code here, checks for presence at least
    75% of the time, which should be adequate.
    
    Also, as the new mode configuration code has already taken care to enable
    the CRT output, eliminate much of the load detection code which is simply
    duplicating functionality from the general mode setting code. This should
    result in faster load detection as this code will now run in no more than
    one frame time. It does burn the CPU the whole time though, polling the
    displayed scanline register.

    The fixed panel timing will only be available when the LVDS is already on
    at X startup.
    
    So far, our only mostly-working LVDS driver is for the i830, and on i830 the
    LVDS is always on DVOA, so use that for all LVDS chips.  This may need to
    change if we support the ch7017 I've seen used on embedded i845, for example.

    Ignore VideoRam now that its original purpose is obsolete.

    Allow physical-memory allocations within stolen memory.
    
    Because stolen memory happens to be a contiguous block of high system memory,
    we can just read the GTT entries for it to get physical addresses for our
    allocations there if needed.  This reduces fragmentation of the aperture space,
    and will often reclaim up to 7 MB of memory that had been left unused since the
    simplified aperture manager was put in place, but without reintroducing the
    complexities of the old aperture manager.

    Implement the custom I2C protocol used by the ivch DVO.
    
    The ihch DVO uses a modified I2C addressing scheme as described
    in section 5.2 of the data sheet.  Implement this by over-riding
    the I2C read and write word routines.

    CRTC Rotation under XAA wasn't hitting accelerated path.
    
    The server rotation code is now using the root window in IncludeInferiors
    mode rather than using the screen pixmap. Change the XAA Composite code
    to check for this case now.

    EXA: don't smash vertex header in G965
    
    Originally we smashed vertex header to store texture
    coordinates, this is working as we only use sf/wm kernel
    and disable all other stages on pipeline. But better to
    not do this. This also cleans up vertex elements state
    and makes vertex buffer order looks "normal".

    Make i830_sdvo_write_sdvox write everything twice.
    
    For some reason, certain chips don't correctly enable the SDVO hardware when
    this register is written only once. We're following what the BIOS code does
    and writing it twice now, but with extra posting reads to boot. Yes, this is
    cult-and-paste, but it fixes problems found on deployed hardware.

    Allocate 4 separate buffers for HW Cursors on Linux.
    
    Linux cannot allocate a large fixed buffer for the HW cursors as needed for
    FreeBSD; instead, allocate four separate buffers. The code now prefers to
    allocate one buffer (less overhead) and falls back to separate buffers only
    when necessary.

    Fix crashes and other failures when a cursor allocation fails.
    
    Now, we allocate one single block of memory for cursors, and either succeed or
    fail once, rather than trying to support partial fallback modes that generally
    resulted in pain due to being untested.  In particular, this fixes cursors on
    FreeBSD, which only allowed one large physically-contiguous allocation.

commit b07dfbba5df7728232b38211c623185116dcea5c

    Remove leftover code that was disabling tiling after we set it up.

commit 94c37f35872487c04136fb659526bffefd9c46ad
Author: Eric Anholt <eric@anholt.net>
Date:   Tue Mar 6 13:57:04 2007 -0800

    Make the depth buffer X tiled instead of Y, and fix a Y tiling nit on 945.
    
    The previous code claimed to set the depth buffer up as Y tiled, but due to
    lack of implementation in SetFence, it ended up being X tiled.  Actually
    setting the Y tiling flag in the new version broke the depth buffer, so just
    switch the depth buffer to X tiling, which appears to work fine.

    Continue to allocate the legacy texture pool by default.
    
    This is a partial revert of 7358642e64ab6d13bc1dc1a44703ee66d715ff61
    
    If we don't allocate it now, when the DRM version is too low there won't be any
    memory allocated and DRI will fail.  Instead, waste the memory in the i915tex
    case for now, and leave fixing it right (check DRM version up front and decide
    which memory manager to set up) to later.

    Fix some conditionals related to triple buffering.
    
    Guard code that dereferences pI830->third_buffer with tests for that instead of
    pI830->TripleBuffer. It could happen that we want to enable triple buffering
    but (temporarily) can't because the third buffer couldn't be allocated.

    Make the application of crtc desiredModes generic code instead of
    per-driver by creating xf86SetDesiredModes from the code that was in EnterVT

    Also, move the frame buffer clear until just before mode setting to make
    sure things are mapped correctly.

    Move EXA offscreen memory back after framebuffer to avoid fallbacks.
    
    Without this, the EXA code decides that the framebuffer is not in video
    memory because it's not located between the start of video memory and the end
    of EXA allocator memory.  We should either have EXA let the driver decide if a
    pointer is in video memory, or add a new field for "end of video memory" (not
    just end of EXA offscreen allocation), but this fixes things for now.

    Move memory allocation to ScreenInit rather than PreInit.
    
    This lets us do memory allocation just once rather than having several passes
    (as long as things succeed), avoids trouble with zaphod mode, and will let us
    do better automatic sizing of allocations soon.

Author: Eric Anholt <eric@anholt.net>
Date:   Thu Feb 22 10:41:09 2007 -0800

    Rework the video memory allocation.
    
    The previous allocator worked in multiple passes, with (at least) one of
    setting up allocations, another to attempt to adjust those for tiling, and
    then a pass to set up the offsets and fix them in memory.
    
    The new allocator is simpler, allocating memory immediately if possible,
    setting up tiling up front, and choosing offsets immediately.  AGP memory
    is only allocated to back actual memory used, saving some memory that would
    have been allocated for padding previous. It will also allow dynamic freeing
    and reallocation of memory, which will be useful for framebuffer resizing.

Author: Keith Packard <keithp@guitar.keithp.com>
Date:   Tue Feb 20 23:10:17 2007 -0800

    Pre-965 hardware had fixed pipe 1 for panel fitter.
    
    The pipe mode setting code needs to disable the panel fitter when using the
    pipe for things other than LVDS output. The driver was checking for panel
    fitter conflicts using bits that the 965 chipset defines for selecting which
    pipe the panel fitter is connected to. However, on pre-965 hardware, the
    panel fitter works only with pipe 1 and those bits returned 0.
    
    The result was that when pipe 1 was using the panel fitter, configuring pipe
    0 would disable the panel fitter.
    
    The fix provided uses a model-specific test for the panel fitter pipe.

    These two sources are placed in higher priority to the BIOS data when

    remains useful for the situation where we want to turn on LVDS but there is no
    EDID available and no current mode programmed (i.e. booting with VGA or TV

    Merge branch 'modesetting-rotation' into modesetting
    
    This adds reasonably driver-independent rotation support to the common
    layer. The piece required in the driver is to allocate and redirect the crtc
    to a shadow frame buffer. The driver uses Render to perform the actual
    rotation operation (which leaves us free to do fun projective transforms at
    some point in the future :-).

    Bug #9680: Remove bogus blank length limiting in xf86SetModeCrtc().
    
    Our modes typically come from EDID or default modes, and when the monitor
    asks for a specific mode, deciding to tweak it usually results in incorrect
    display.  And if the user is specifying a mode by hand, tweaking it then is
    still pretty rude.

    When converting from global cursor to per-crtc cursor, the ARGB cursor data
    was accidentally painted to the wrong location, overwriting some critical

    cursor image from uninitialized data).

    Bug #8845: Unify all our XV ports to 1920x1088 maximum size.
    
    This increases the "legacy" size, but that was checked against the 845
    documentation which claims support for 2048x2048 as well.  It decreases the
    textured video size, which was running into the limits of the bigrequests
    extension.  The new limits should fit within bigrequests while still supporting
    HD videos.

    Don't limit cachelines to a vertical of 2048, and increase default allocation.
    
    The cachelines are used for two things: XAA pixmap cache and XV memory.
    Only XAA pixmap cache is referred to using an offset pointing at the
    beginning of the front buffer in rendering, and XAA only uses the 2d BLT
    engine, which actually has a vertical limit of 65536.  So, pixmap cache is now
    limited to that much vertical.
    
    Additionally, the previous cachelines allocation was too small for our
    advertised XV limits, so video at the limits would fail with BadAlloc.  Now,
    XAA allocates the same approximate amount of offscreen memory as EXA:
    3 times the screen size, plus one packed HD video.

    Correct x/y/pitch limitations in several cases, and detail them in i830_exa.c.
    
    This reduces max framebuffer width and increases max framebuffer height on
    965, reduces max X/Y on pre-965 EXA (could have caused mis-rendering), and
    increases max X/Y on 965 EXA (would have prevented acceleration).

    We should just call i830MarkSync/i830WaitSync in places we need,
    which care for both XAA and EXA.

    being uninitialized when outputs are first brought up.

    intel_output->pI2CBus isn't initialized until the output is all happy and
    running, so using it before that is rather unlikely to do much good.

    Detect in ProbeModes. Let get_modes set edid. Prune interlace/dblscan.
    
    Move output connection status detection from RandR code up to ProbeModes so
    it is done before mode sets are built. Otherwise, the mode building code
    will elide all modes the first time through as it ignores outputs that are
    disconnected.
    
    Most get_modes functions fetch EDID data; make sure that any
    EDID changes are used in the ProbeModes filtering of default modes.
    Otherwise, stale EDID data will be used.
    
    Allow outputs to advertise support for interlaced and double scan modes;
    prune such modes from the default mode list when outputs do not support them.

    Remove 8MB/32MB default VideoRam limits.
    
    With modern monitors and increased XV and EXA memory requirements, these small
    limits were resulting in DRI and other initialization failures because we
    wouldn't allow them enough memory.  Instead, allow each piece of the system
    (DRI, EXA, XAA, etc) to request as much memory as it wants, and choose the
    actual videoRam to be used for laying out the memory afterwards.
    
    With this change, in the absence of a VideoRam option, 32MB will be allocated
    for textures.

    The documentation states that GPIOB is (generally) used for devices on DVOA
    on the motherboard, which appears to be the case on the laptop we have with
    LVDS on the motherboard.
    
    This patch is probably not entirely accurate, as there was apparently an LVDS
    DVO card sold that could be put in desktop machines, which would likely be on
    GPIOE like other ADD cards.  Given that we couldn't find one of these cards for
    purchase, I'm not worrying about it.

    Bug #7524: Major improvements to EXA/XAA static memory allocation.
    
    With this, we no longer allocate XV through the XF86 linear allocator in the
    EXA case.  We also no longer allocate extra space for the XF86 2D allocator
    that we don't use in EXA mode, or space for the EXA allocator in XAA mode.
    The EXA offscreen allocator now gets enough space for several screenfuls of
    pixmaps plus one 1920x1088 movie.
    
    A large duplicated section of code for allocating each framebuffer in the old
    dual-screen mode was also factored out.

    TV subcarrier was computed from wrong clock value.
    
    The constants provided in the documentation for the subcarrier DDA values
    assumed the clock was programmed to precisely 108MHz, but the PLL can't hit
    that value exactly (or our PLL computation can't, in any case). The
    result was an incorrect subcarrier frequency which resulted in synthetic
    subcarrier phase shift and a lovely rainbow effect on the screen.
    
    Unfortunately, the documentation didn't exactly describe the function
    performed by the subcarrier clock hardware, so a bit of detective work was
    needed. New constants were computed using the code in tv.5c and those, along
    with lots of other values from the documentation were inserted into the
    necessary tables.
    
    The result appears to generate stable NTSC video on the svideo connector.

    DGA has a copy of the current mode list (yes, this is broken).
    Regenerate it whenever the ddx mode list changes.

    TV output I830OutputPrivate had wrong type (crashed in SetMode).
    
    TV output private type field was set to I830_OUTPUT_SDVO instead of
    I830_OUTPUT_TVOUT. When DGA mode setting occurred, the sdvo output debug
    code would be invoked and attempt to dereference sdvo-specific bits of the
    private structure leading to a segfault.

    be set correctly in the screen structure, unless it was computed from the

    The old Init() function is removed and the previous Detect() function is now
    init().  This leaves us room in the namespace for a detect() like other
    outputs have ("is the monitor connected?").  Also, Power() became dpms(),
    taking a DPMSMode*.  In general, the mode setting path now matches the intel
    internal path, except for the lack of mode_fixup().

    DOUBLE_WIDE mode for high pixel clock 8xx. Rewrite PLL search.
    
    High pixel clock modes on pipe A of an 8xx chip require
    DOUBLE_WIDE mode. It's supposed to be modes > 180MHz or so,
    but the board I have requires DOUBLE_WIDE mode for clocks > 108MHz
    or so. The limit is related to the core clock speed of the chip, which
    can be found indirectly through PCI config space. None of the possible
    values explain why this board needs this mode for these relatively low
    clock rates though.
    
    Also, create tables of data for the PLL computation and use them
    instead of code. I think it's cleaner looking. It is also untested on
    9xx. It'll work. Really.

    Tristate the clock/data pins during GPIO when released while getting values.
    
    While the register is laid out suggesting that you can read a low value while
    driving the output high, and the I2C spec seems to indicate that you should be
    able to as well, and on some hardware this works successfully, on the i865 and
    perhaps some other chips it doesn't.  So, if we're not holding the clock or
    data pin low during GetBits, tristate the pin so that we can successfully read.
    
    This fixes i865 analog (VGA) DDC so it successfully sees slave acks.
    
    Also, improve the I2C bit-banging debugging.

    Properly detect the GTT size on the G965.
    
    In the past, the GTT has always been sized just large enough to map the whole
    graphics aperture.  However, apparently on the G965 that isn't the case, and
    it is actually 512KB on hardware with a 256MB aperture.  This resulted in X
    not bothering to allocate memory for 256KB that it thought was already mapped
    into stolen memory, and thus garbage rendering (particularly visible in large
    video modes that displayed this unallocated memory).  The kernel happens to
    get the right answer by hardwiring a 512KB GTT size already, but that may not
    be true on future hardware.
    
    Instead, we use a convenient field in PGETBL_CTL that's specifically for the
    GTT size rather than the aperture size, which gets us the answer we want.

    Revert "Don't allocate stuff in the first 256K of video memory (GATT?)"
    
    This reverts commit 997e8c9bb4235cab1fff4738387df9afcbea0a03.
    
    The GTT is definitely located at the end of stolen memory.  This commit
    apparently worked around mis-estimation of the GTT size.

    The current server version (7.1.99.2) is still left as requiring compat code,
    since the version hasn't been bumped yet.
    
    This also fixes some failures to call the compat code, and some failures to
    actually compile the compat code.  Oops.

    As part of the separation of driver-dependent from driver-independent code,

    means the driver shouldn't even know about RandR, while the
    driver-independent code does.

    DSPSURF must be page aligned. Place intra-screen offset in DSPBASE.
    
    DSPASURF/DSPBSURF can only take page aligned values, ignoring
    the lower order bits. So, place the offset for the output
    within the frame buffer in the DSPABASE/DSPBBASE registers instead.

    Don't allocate stuff in the first 256K of video memory (GATT?)
    
    Letting the ring buffer or other objects be allocated within the lowest
    portion of memory appears to trash some memory mapping data; I'm assuming
    this is the GATT table on the 965. Just marking this out of bounds for
    allocation fixes this problem.

    Fix CRT output on 965 chipset.
    
    A few more register settings are needed to get CRT output working on the
    965 chipset, in particular the the SDVO/UDI clock multiplier register
    needed to get set to the default value (3). No, I really don't know what
    this does, but it does get the CRT running at a wide range of sizes.

    Disable the panel fitter when not using it. Cleans up SDVO DVI output.
    
    The panel fitter appears to exist on the 965 hardware (at least) and
    causes troubles with DVI output over SDVO when enabled. This patch
    checks to see if the panel fitter is pointing at the pipe being configured
    and disables it unconditionally in that case. The LVDS driver will configure
    it correctly if necessary afterwards.

    Move mode lists from per-pipe to per-output.
    
    This should let RandR do the right thing in exposing the modes to userland.
    
    As a side effect of getting this working, the SDVO pixel clock range code
    was fixed and the mode valid tests for various outputs got extended.  Also,
    LVDS grew a get_modes for the fixed panel mode.
    
    Note that we now no longer do automatic enabling of outputs at xrandr -s 0,
    hotkey, or VT switch.  That will be left to generic RandR code later.  Also,
    generic modes and user-defined modes are once again not validated into the
    lists, so this is a regression there.

    or standard VESA modes) to create the list to expose through RandR.  That
    isn't done yet.

    Major cleanup of 3D invariant state, fixing hangs with rotation and render.
    
    Now, the generic invariant state is always set while the X Server is active,
    and happens automatically when the X Server grabs the DRI lock.  More 3D state
    is moved to the generic code.
    
    Then, the 3D consumers (video, rotation, render) set last_3d to their enum
    entry, and can update their own invariant state when another consumer was
    active.

    The main change is to send SDVO commands using data passed into the send
    command function, and receive responses into memory passed into the read
    response function, rather than stuff things in/out through dev_priv->sdvo_regs.
    This lets us use structures to represent some arguments, which results in a
    nice cleanup (and 100% fewer arguments named magicN as a side effect).
    
    Also, the mode set path is changed to not do any preferred input timing
    work.  We weren't doing anything legitimate with the results, since we didn't
    modify the CRTC timing appropriately, so now we just stuff the CRTC timing into
    both and hope for the best.  This should probably be revisited later.

    Clean up SDVO code, moving the private structure internal and cleaning up caps.
    
    All the SDVO code should now be in lower case rather than StudlyCaps.
    
    This also adjusts the I2C setup to create a bus per SDVO output we set up.
    The previous setup with shared buses was failing in some circumstances, which
    is probably due to the lack of refcounting in xf86i2c.c.

    This is the TV connector on board for the 915GM and 945GM.
    
    It is currently not hooked up to output initialization as it's entirely
    untested.  However, I think this is a reasonable starting point for getting
    TV-out actually working.

    Move per-output mode setting code to per-output methods.
    
    This is not a very clean interface, as a number of outputs require tweaks to
    the DPLL registers.  When possible, the DPLLs are just adjusted in the
    per-output post_set_mode, which happens just after the DPLL is enabled.
    However, this seems better than the previous method of having all outputs
    programmed in the same function.

    Attempt to make the ACPI hotkey support a little more modesetting-compatible.
    
    Previously, we watched for the BIOS to have changed the layout, and repaired
    the resulting configuration.  Now, we request that the BIOS make no changes,
    but leave a note in a register for when the key has been pressed.  When we
    notice this, we reprobe monitors and turn on/off the things we find.
    
    This is a temporary solution until we can get the hotkey hooked up as an
    input key to external applications to control the change using RandR 1.2.  It
    is also untested as neither of my laptops do anything with the hotkey.
    However, this code does result in many fewer BIOS calls.

    Construct default monitor description for hotplug non-DDC monitor.
    
    When detecting a monitor that doesn't support DDC, construct a default
    monitor with "sensible" values instead of using whatever the builtin LCD
    screen uses. Clearly we need a way to set the monitor parameters when we
    cannot detect them.

    Update driver for RandR 1.2 X server API.
    
    This is not entirely what I'd like to see, but it's at least functional.
    
    Limitations:
    	Can't disable/enable crtcs
    	Can't move outputs on/off crtcs
    
    But, it does handle monitor hot-plug, detecting changes in VGA and SDVO
    status on-the fly. Which makes for good demo material.

    Add a check for intel-gen4asm, and rules to compile {wm,sf}_prog.h using it.
    
    This adds assembly source for the two programs used in the textured video
    implementation on the 965, which should make them easier to modify in the
    future. The compiled versions are also included, so that intel-gen4asm isn't a
    build requirement for people that aren't modifying these programs.
    
    There are minor differences in the compiled versions of these programs compared
    to their previous versions which were compiled with a different tool.  I
    believe the changes should be harmless, and video continues to work on my
    system.

    Disable dynamic front buffer mapping on i965.
    
    Moving front buffers should only be necessary for rotation.  Currently, the
    server isn't ready for it, and the method attempted to work around it caused
    crashes with DRI.  Since i965 doesn't support rotation yet, this should be
    harmless for now.

    Disable drawing to PICT_a8, and turn on support for non-extended repeats.
    
    We don't know what COLOR_BUF_8BIT does, so it's disabled for now while we're
    stabilizing the code.
    
    The non-extended repeats appear to be working according to the rendercheck
    tests on a8 and a8r8g8b8 sources.  Masks continue to hang the card, as before
    this change.

    Try to fix up the basic RepeatNormal and RepeatNone support.
    
    With RepeatNone, access outside of the drawable should return 0 alpha values,
    which is done by using the border color.  For RepeatNormal, we use the wrap
    mode (which requires that we use normalized texture coordinates).

    Disable spread spectrum clock usage.
    
    The spread spectrum clock generator that improves EMI characteristics for
    laptop screens lives in an external chip that is programmed over an i2c bus.
    Without correct programming, attempts to use this mode for the LVDS can
    result in a DC signal being sent to the panel.
    
    Until we find programming information for this external chip, we should
    leave this mode disabled.

    Bug #7443: Respect the user's Modes configuration, and make it more useful.
    
    Now, mode names generated by DDC get names of the form "WIDTHxHEIGHTxREFRESH".
    The matching for user Modes lines takes the user Modes as the prefix that
    needs to match, rather than an exact string match or "WIDTHxHEIGHT" match.  So
    one can, for example, specify "1024x768" to get any old 1024x768, or
    1024x768x60 to get one of the modes named 1024x768x60.

    Replace xf86ValidateModes usage with a set of custom validators and pruning.
    
    This moves us to maintaining MonPtrs per pipe instead of using the EDID
    structure "xf86MonPtr", which is closer to what we want to be looking at when
    doing validation.  The new validation isn't enough yet -- particularly, we
    aren't importing and validating the custom modelines to the pipes when
    applicable, but this will be easier than (for example) trying to make flat
    panel modes pass xf86ValidateModes through various gross hacks.
    
    Hotplug turn-on/off also happens at SwitchMode time now, instead of at randr
    probe time.

    If the panel power registers are all zeroes on Mobile parts, disable LVDS.
    
    This is the case on the Mac mini, which is an i945GM but has no LVDS attached.
    Powering on with the power timing registers zeroed would probably be a bad idea,
    even if there was a panel attached.

Author: Eric Anholt <anholt@FreeBSD.org>
Date:   Mon Jun 26 07:46:28 2006 +0200

    Major cleanup of mode reprobing:
    - Don't mess with pScrn->monitor->Modes, and instead make our own availModes.
    - Don't re-program the pipe with the same values (no flicker at xrandr)
    - Move a bunch of stuff that should be exposed through the public API (probably)
      to i830_xf86Modes.c
    - Use a table with established modes plus GTF to come up with modes from EDID,
      instead of trying to walk and find one in pScrn->monitor->Modes.  I think
      this is correct.
    - Reset clone state if we've detected new pipes, which should turn on the
      cursor.

Author: Eric Anholt <anholt@FreeBSD.org>
Date:   Fri Jun 23 23:29:55 2006 -0700

    WIP to allow re-probing and validation of modes for new heads at "xrandr" time.
    
    Now, DDC modes always end up being preferred to custom modelines, even if
    smaller.  This should probably be fixed by inserting custom modelines into
    the probed mode list if they're valid according to the probed parameters of the
    monitor.
    
    Too much code is lifted from static functions in xf86Mode.c, and those should be
    made unstatic if possible.  Using xf86ValidateModes is also rather hacky, and
    I want to break the function down, but this is a first step.

Author: Eric Anholt <anholt@FreeBSD.org>
Date:   Fri Jun 23 18:21:17 2006 -0700

    Split probed modes out per pipe, and union them into the available modes.
    
    This is the first stage of getting runtime monitor attachment.  The old i830
    GTF code is returned to use to provide suitable modelines for xf86ValidateModes
    in the LVDS case, even though the LVDS doesn't care about the modeline and just
    always programs its fixed values.

    Fix SDVO output at low pixel clocks.
    
    I had interpreted the docs as saying that the multiplier setting would further
    divide the clock and stuff dummy bytes in.  Instead, we have to set the DPLL at
    the higher clock rate, and the pixel multiplier just controls the stuffing of
    dummy bytes.  Also, we have to set the multiplier both in the graphics chip and
    on the SDVO device on the other side.

    Start trying to implement DDC over SDVO.  It's slightly tricky because the
    control bus will reset from DDC mode to internal-registers mode after every
    Stop afer a Start on the DDC bus.  The xf86 DDC code causes multiple Start/Stops
    in one probe.  So, we create a wrapper bus that does the control bus switch at
    every Start.  It's not working yet on my hardware, but I'm pretty sure this is
    the right way to go.

    Improve LVDS modes when outputting a CRT+LVDS combo at larger than the LVDS's
    panel size.  This is a hack until we get better clone mode, but it correctly
    displays a subset of the root on the LVDS by using a correct pixel clock and
    pipe/display size.

    Move the PFIT enabling before the enabling of the pipe, as the specs say we
    should.  This doesn't work yet, as we apparently need to adjust the pipe to
    output at the full resolution of the panel, not the displayed image size,
    because PFIT controls scaling between the display planes and the pipe.

    I have resolved this by making all the "Direct rendering disabled" messages
    X_WARNING and all the "Direct rendering enabled" messages X_INFO.  Ideally,
    we need to factor some of this stuff out to common code.  There is a *LOT* of
    duplication among the *_dri.c files under programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/drivers.
    
    I'm trying to clean up as much low hanging fruit as I can and got tired of

    Post-merge fixups:
    - Disable building the gamma driver
    - Fix numerous Imakefiles to get header paths and subdirs right
    - Symlink client-side GLX lib source from Mesa
    - Add new shader subdirs to the Mesa core build
    - Tweak the DDX drivers to not ask for "xf86dri.h"; they don't need

    been commented out as it didn't seem to be necessary (Egbert Eich).

    header location and type changes, and update the ChangeLog.

    Merge DRI-trunk-20040613 changes in programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/drivers, with
    the following notes:
    
    - Savage and Mach64 (= ati/ati*.[ch] changes) DRI not merged due to insecurity.
    - VIA driver converted to new drmContext and drmHandle names.
    - Radeon driver merge conflicted in many places, and MergedFB at least could
      probably use some checking at this point.
