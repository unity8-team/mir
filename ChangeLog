	* src/radeon.h:
	* src/radeon_chipset.h:
	* src/radeon_driver.c:
	* src/radeon_probe.c:
	Add pci ids known to exist (see #4284 for instance). There are still
	entries which probably don't really exist (cancelled cards and such),
	leave them as-is. Fix the name of some entries, mostly based on the
	.inf file of the newest catalyst driver. Use own family id for rv410
	and rs400, though there is no different code (yet?).

	* src/radeon_reg.h:
	* src/radeon_render.c: (RADEONSetupRenderByteswap):
	Memory map and misc fixes. This completely reworks the way the driver
	detects available & accessible video memory and initializes the card
	internal memory map. Along the way, I re-ordered some of the stuffs
	in pre-init in order to remove some dodgy codepath, fixed various
	init, exit and vt switch issues, and overall made the driver more
	robust. The full memory map fix requires an updated DRM. The X driver
	no longer tries to position the AGP aperture, this becomes entirely
	DRM responsibility.

2006-02-16  Benjamin Herrenschmidt  <benh@kernel.crashing.org>

	* src/radeon_accel.c: (RADEONEngineRestore):
	The engine setup would trigger a bogus line write before the proper
	addresses are setup, thus causing the card to try to bus master over
	the system bus to some stale location (usually 0 but could depend on
	whatever was used before X). Remove that useless init bit, and always
	setup some good enough engine source & destination pointers in case we
	have some other spurrious engine activity going on.

	* src/radeon_driver.c (RADEONPreInitModes): 
	When failing to parse MetaModes, reset CRT2pScrn to NULL after 
	free'ing it so we don't crash when trying to use it later 
	(such as in RADEONFreeRec).
