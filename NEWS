Release 2.20.4 (2012-08-18)
===========================
Continuing the small bugfix releases, the only real feature is initial
enabling for Haswell for the purpose of rendering verification and
validation - by no means is it complete!

Bugs fixed since 2.20.3:

  * Some potential errors along failure paths found by a static analyser
  with the help of Zdenek Kablac.

  * Eliminate zero-sized rectangles from PolyFillRectangles as the code
  assumes that they did not exist and so caused corruption.

  * Remove the UXA warning for failing to tile the front buffer if it is
  disallowed by hardware, and so expected.

  * Fix the validation of the XV pipe parameter.

  * Fix 8x8 tiled pattern fills
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53353

  * Fix compile failure when using --with-builderstring

  * Restore w/a flush for gen4 fill/copy/video, fortunately rare
  operations as at least for fill/copy we prefer to use the BLT.
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53119

  * Restore preferred use of the RENDER ring for SNB+ DRI copies.

Release 2.20.3 (2012-08-04)
===========================
Just a minor bugfix for gen4 chipsets (965gm, gm45 and friends) that
crept into 2.20.2. As an added bonus, the pessimistic workaround for a
GPU hang on gen4 has been relaxed and the shaders have been overhauled
which should pave the way to eliminating the last of the uncommon CPU
operations, along with immediately realising a small perforamnce
improvement.

Bugs fixed since 2.20.2:

 * Update DPMS bookkeeping after modeset
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52142

 * Avoid overlapping gpu/cpu damage after ignoring cpu damage in the
   consideration of placement for the operation.

 * Enable acceleration by default on 830gm/845g. The GMCH on this pair
   of chipsets is notoriously incoherent, so the GPU is almost certainly
   going to hang at some point, though unlikely to hang the system and
   should automatically disable acceleration (and thence behave
   identically as if the acceleration was disabled from the start).
   Option "NoAccel" can be used to disable all 2D acceleration and
   Option "DRI" can be used to disable all 3D acceleration.
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52624

 * Fix vertex bookkeeping for gen4 that was causing corruption in the
   command stream.

Release 2.20.2 (2012-07-27)
===========================
For the last 9 months, since 2.16.901, we have been shipping a driver that
does not work on IvyBridge GT1 systems (HD2500 graphics); we were telling
the GPU to use an invalid number of threads for the pixel shader and this
in turned caused the GPU to hang.

Also fixed since the last release just a few days ago:

* Support for the gmux backlight controller on Apple laptops
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52423

* Fix X -configure not to list this driver as matching any Intel device,
  just the VGA class devices will do!

* A crash in SNA when repeatedly switching xrandr rotations

* Corruption in SNA observed in kwin on IvyBridge
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52473

Release 2.20.1 (2012-07-22)
===========================
A week in, grab the brown paper bags, for it is time to reveal a couple
of critical bugs that spoilt the 2.20.0 release.

Firstly we have the restoration of DRI for i810. I am sure that the
solitary user will be overjoyed in a couple of years when a new xserver
is forced upon him. That enjoyment will be short-lived when as no actual
acceleration remains, not even shadow, for the chipset.

Perhaps a little more wildly felt, I hope!, will be that the SNA
fallbacks were broken on 64-bit machines if they required clipping. One
little misplaced cast of a pointer, and the screen is filled with
corruption.

Among the other tweaks this week:

* A bug affecting gen4 handling of trapezoids was fixed, and CPU
  overhead reduced.
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52158

* A fix for a bug causing corruption of a DRI2 unredirected client
  window that was resized whilst under a compositor.

* Support for snoopable buffers on non-LLC architectures, coming to
  a future kernel. The aim to accelerate transfers between the CPU
  and the GPU, in particular to dramatically improve readback
  performance, and to further minimise clflushes.

* Improvement to the composite performance on GT2 SandyBridge and
  IvyBridge devices, in particular the render copy is significantly
  improved.

* Improved handling for when acceleration is disabled, including
  permitting DRI2 to remain supported even if the X server believes
  the GPU wedged.

* Shadow support was dropped from UXA as it was neither complete nor
  correct, use SNA instead.

Release 2.20.0 (2012-07-15)
===========================
First the big news, a new acceleration method that aims to be faster and
consume far less CPU than UXA is now available for selection at runtime.
This snazzy new architecture can be selected through use of
  Option "AccelMethod" "sna"
in your xorg.conf. Whilst it has been under development for some time, it
has not yet had the same degree of widespread testing of UXA, so tread
lightly. Try it and if you spot anything that can be improved, please do
report a bug.

Otherwise we have the usual smattering of bug fixes for UXA:

 * Use a white source whilst adding glyphs to the glyph mask
   (This fixes blank glyphs if using a font that mixes ARGB and A glyphs.)

 * Avoid fallbacks for glyph-to-dst in e.g. gnome-terminal
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50508

 * Force unused outputs off when VT switching
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50772

 * Copy the fbcon across to the Screen pixmap at startup.
   (This patch has been kicking around in the distributions for years.)

 * Many missed malloc failures checks and forgotten frees found by a static
   analyzer. Thanks Zdenek Kabelac!

 * Leak of the back buffer when terminating an application after pageflipping
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50670

 * Double check that the pipe is on before emitting a WAIT_ON_EVENT.
   In conjunction with an uptodate kernel, this should eliminate any
   hangs when changing resolutions or adding/removing displays.
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50668

 * Update to new Xorg APIs. Future proofing for the next generation of
   hotplug Xorg display servers.

Many thanks to everyone who has reported a bug and otherwise helped to
improve the driver.

Release 2.19.0 (2012-04-29)
===========================
More stability fixes for UXA and support for another variant of IvyBridge.
Given the severity of the stability fixes, I strongly recommend everybody
to upgrade to 2.19.0.

* Prevent waiting on scanlines whilst not in control of the VT and therefore
  whilst referencing foreign CRTC configurations.

* Pixmap (and bo leak) during fallback glyph composition

* Remove broken acceleration for rendering glyphs directly upon the
  destination pixmap, exposed by cairo-1.12.0 (and coincidentally fix
  another Pixmap leak upon fallback handling).

* Add support for Ivy Bridge GT2 Server chipset [PCI id 0x016a]

* Remove broken damage flushing with CompositeRectangles
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32547

* Fix crash upon server start with multiple monitors
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47395

* Fix composition issues resulting from overly aggressive Pixmap reuse
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47345

Release 2.18.0 (2012-02-24)
===========================
Time passes, a few more bugs have crept out of the woodwork that are a
compelling reason to update.

Bugs fixed in this release (compared to 2.17.0)
-----------------------------------------------

* Limit maximum object size so that all of the source, mask and
  destination can be mapped into the aperture simultaneously by basing the
  limit on the mappable aperture size rather than the size of the total
  GATT.

* Incorrect clipping of polygons
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43649
  Regression from 2.15.901

* Limit number of VMA cached to avoid hitting the per-process VMA limit
  There still is a residual bug in that we seem to have so many objects
  floating around in the first place and that still leads to exhaustion
  of system limits.
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43075
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40066

* Latency in processing user-input during continuous rendering

Release 2.17.0 (2011-11-16)
==============================
A few months have passed, and we have accumulated a surprising number of
bug fixes. Oops! We would strongly encourage everyone to upgrade.

Bugs fixed in this snapshot (compared to 2.16.902)
--------------------------------------------------

* Video clobbering composite batch state
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=635953

Snapshot 2.16.902 (2011-11-13)
==============================
This is the second release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.17.0 release. We will appreciate any feedback we can get from
testing of this snapshot, and thanks to everyone who tested and reported
upon issues in the last snapshot.

A very old bug demonstrating that nobody has ever used alpha maps, and a
couple of more recent mistakes were found.

Bugs fixed in this snapshot (compared to 2.16.901)
--------------------------------------------------

 * Incorrect reuse of surface bindings within a batch for multiple formats
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40926

 * Nothing was rendered for text with procedural sources
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31819

 * Handle fallbacks involving alpha maps

Snapshot 2.16.901 (2011-10-30)
==============================
This is the first release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.17.0 release. We will appreciate any feedback we can get from
testing of this snapshot.

The basis of this release are to push out a couple of critical stability
fixes for SandyBridge and IvyBridge. There is very little else to see
here. Those 200+ other commits do not exist...

Bugs fixed in this snapshot (compared to 2.16.0)
--------------------------------------------------

 * Workaround blitter hang on SandyBridge and IvyBridge
   https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=27892
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi

 * Workaround pipe control issues on SandyBridge

 * Use correct maximum PS thread count on IvyBridge

 * Protect against failed pixmap allocation for XV
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40439

Release 2.16.0 (2011-08-09)
==============================
A new quarter, a new release! The key feature of this release, looking past
the bug fixes, is the enabling of IvyBridge acceleration. We have also fixed
many bugs and graphical glitches and would encourage everyone to upgrade.

Bugs fixed in this snapshot (compared to 2.15.901)
--------------------------------------------------

* Build fix for xserver-1.7.7

Snapshot 2.15.901 (2011-07-30)
==============================
This is the first release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.16.0 release. We will appreciate any feedback we can get from
testing of this snapshot.

The highlight of this snapshot is the full enabling of IvyBridge with
acceleration for Render and Xv, along with handling of the shared render
buffer allocations required for Mesa. Also of note is that deep-color
support is enabled (for all chipsets), which allows you to drive your
30-bit monitor at its native colour depth.

Bugs fixed in this snapshot (compared to 2.15.0)
--------------------------------------------------

* Misuse of the Resource database causing crashes after DRI clients close
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37700

* Crash on large strings
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36860

* Incorrect rendering for some core drawing operations
  http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28768
  http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28798
  http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28908
  http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29401

* Crash in Xv due to insufficient checks on batch space
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36319

Release 2.15.0 (2011-04-14)
==============================
We are pleased to announce this major release of the xf86-video-intel
driver, roughly on schedule at 3 months since 2.14.0. With the many bug
fixes in this release, we encourage everyone to upgrade to 2.15.

The priority for this quarter has been simply to be unexciting and stabilise
the driver further, seeking to capitalise upon the improvements elsewhere
in the stack.

Bugs fixed in this snapshot (compared to 2.14.903)
--------------------------------------------------

* Turn off relaxed fencing by default for older chipsets
  This was continuing to destabilize those system, so for the release
  we disabled the feature. If you wish to help us debug this, you can
  re-enable the optimisation with Option "RelaxedFencing" "True".
  Bugzilla: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36147

* Build fix for xserver-1.7.7

* KDE glitches on SNB
  [Technically fixed in the previous snapshot, but I'm really pleased
   that this got fixed in time for the release!]
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35808


Snapshot 2.14.903 (2011-04-11)
==============================
This is the third release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.15.0 release. We will appreciate any feedback we can get from
testing of this snapshot.

There was a bit of churn since 2.14.902 as a potential fix for a
performance regression was tried but had to reverted when it was found to
cause glitches running Compiz on SandyBridge. Otherwise, there were just a
couple of fixes for building against old xservers and running on an
obscure chipset.

Bugs fixed in this snapshot (compared to 2.14.902)
--------------------------------------------------

* Prevent issuing an invalid scanline wait command
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35576

* The 946GZ in not a 945, but a 965.
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35854

* Fix tile sizes for gen2 (finally).

* Allow building of recent dri2 changes against old xservers.


Snapshot 2.14.902 (2011-03-29)
==============================
This is the second release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.15.0 release. We will appreciate any feedback we can get from
testing of this snapshot.

As befits testing of release candidates, no major regression was found and
a couple more bugs have been fixed.

Bugs fixed in this snapshot (compared to 2.14.901)
--------------------------------------------------

* Clients disappearing with pending swaps

* Incorrect clipping of Xv output on i915 across extended desktops
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35346

* Introduction of a LinearFramebuffer option. (Defaults to tiled for
  performance and power saving.)


Snapshot 2.14.901 (2011-03-02)
==============================
This is the first release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.15.0 release. We will appreciate any feedback we can get from
testing of this snapshot.

Still no further along my grandiose plans to improve Render performance,
aside from the performance tuning lower in the stack, instead we have had
a steady stream of bug fixes.

Bugs fixed in this snapshot (compared to 2.14.0)
------------------------------------------------

* Green pixels within partially off-screen video playback
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24767

* Defer creation of the glyph cache to generation startup
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33412

* Incorrect maximum addresses for video decoder state
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34017

* Failure to handle oversized temporary surfaces
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34399

* Relaxed tiling corruption on gen2

* Crash when destroying a foreign DRI drawable
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34787


Release 2.14.0 (2011-01-07)
===========================
We are pleased to announce this major release of the xf86-video-intel
driver, on schedule at 3 months since 2.13.0. With the many bug fixes
in this release, we encourage everyone to upgrade to 2.14.

The most notable feature of this release is the inclusion of acceleration
support, both RENDER and XVIDEO, for Sandy Bridge; note that this requires
a 2.6.37 kernel. In improving the acceleration code paths to support Sandy
Bridge, we were also able to improve the performance of the general i965+
RENDER acceleration. For example on i3, glyph (aa10 and rgb10) performance
is about 3x faster, as is performing small copies between windows, with the
improvement becoming negligible once you hit around 100 pixels square.


Snapshot 2.13.903 (2010-01-04)
==============================
This is the second release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.14.0 release, and if no showstoppers turn up in wider testing will
become the next release. Besides the usual bug fixes, we've included
patches by Mario Kleiner to improve vblank handing which both improve the
timing accuracy and remove a few potential races -- provided you also
have the corresponding fixes in the kernel.

Bug fixes
---------

 * Crash on hot-unpluging with an active fullscreen GL application, e.g. a
   compositing WM or video player
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32770

 * Freeze upon maximising client-side software renderers, e.g. flash.
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31367

 * Fix confusion over G35 generation
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32478


Snapshot 2.13.902 (2010-12-10)
==============================
This is the first release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.14.0 release. Sandybridge support should be now be ready for use,
and we will appreciate any feedback we can get from this snapshot.
Improving the code base for Sandybridge should also have had knock
on effects for earlier chips as well, in particular Ironlake and to
a lesser extent i965.

New requirements compared to 2.13
---------------------------------
 * Librdrm >= 2.4.23

Bug fixes
---------

 * Crash after failing to allocate memory
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31487

 * EFAULT during pwrite
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29752

 * Mark outputs as on and restore backlight after mode-set

 * A hang with i965+ with newer kernels.


Snapshot 2.13.901 (2010-11-05)
==============================
This is an intermediate snapshot of ongoing driver development. The
primary purpose of this snapshot is to capture some recent
improvements, (particularly in Sandybridge support), for further
testing.

Release 2.13.0 (2010-09-30)
===========================
We are pleased to announce this major release of the xf86-video-intel
driver, on schedule at 3 months since 2.12.0. With the many bug fixes
in this release, we encourage everyone using 2.12 to upgrade to 2.13.

[This release is functionally identical to the earlier 2.12.902
release candidate.]

New requirements compared to 2.12
---------------------------------
 * Librdrm >= 2.4.22

 * Fix to compile for 1.6 series X server.

 * Fix to retry framebuffer allocation after an initial failure.

 * Fix to disable dri2 after fallbacks are forced on.

Snapshot 2.12.902 (2010-09-28)
==============================
This is the second release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.13.0 release. The comes exactly one week after 2.12.902 and includes
only a handful of changes.

One significant change is that the drive now requires libdrm 2.4.22
(or newer), as several people reported compilation failures of
xf86-video-intel 2.12.901 with libdrm 2.4.21.

Other changes include a fix to compile for the 1.6 series X server, a
fix to retry framebuffer allocation after an initial failure, and a
fix to disable dri2 after fallbacks are forced on.

Release 2.12.0 (2010-06-24)
===========================
We are pleased to announce this major release of the xf86-video-intel
2D driver. It contains many correctness and performance improvements
compared to the 2.11 releases. We encourage everyone using 2.11 to
upgrade to 2.12.

[This release contains several bug fixes since the earlier 2.11.901
release candidate---see below for details.]

New requirements compared to 2.11
---------------------------------
 * Libdrm >= 2.4.21

Major performance improvements
------------------------------
There have been many performance improvements targeting the
915G/945G/Pineview graphics chipsets (thank to Chris Wilson!). Areas
improved include:

 * Major improvements to glyph rendering

 * Avoid software fallback when using extended desktops, (for example,
   video playback)

 * Better performance when using large windows, (for example with
   firefox scrolling)

 * Avoiding migration ping-pong with gigantic drawing

The following speedups (measured with cairo-perf-trace/cairo-traces)
capture some of the improvements. These were measured on a Pineview
system with X server 1.8.1. This compares how this 2.12 release
improves performance compared to 2.11.0:

	Trace			Speedup
	-----			-------
	ocitysmap		5.41x speedup
	firefox-talos-gfx       2.41x speedup
	gnome-terminal-vim      2.15x speedup
	poppler                 1.86x speedup
	firefox-planet-gnome	1.43x speedup
	midori-zoomed		1.39x speedup
	swfdec-giant-steps      1.36x speedup
	xfce4-terminal-a1	1.17x speedup
	evolution		1.09x speedup
	swfdec-youtube		1.06x speedup

Other improvements
------------------
Daniel Vetter improved Xvmc and overlay, adding GEM support.

Bug fixes
---------
There have been many conformance improvements targeting the
915G/945G/Pineview graphics chipsets. The rendercheck test suite
passes once again and there has been a significant reduction in the
number of errors detected by the cairo test suite (notably center
sampling and EXTEND_NONE behaviors are fixed).

Other notable bug fixes include:

 * Fix for bug 28446 Garbled fonts with Mathematica
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28446

 * Fixes for page-flipping and other DRI2-handling bugs, (Thanks Jesse
   Barnes, and Kristian Høgsberg)

 * Avoid corruption when using extended desktops, (for example, video
   playback)

(The bug fixes below are new since the 2.11.901 release candidate)

 * Fix corrupted output when screen rotated
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28461

 * Fix corrupted rendering in KDE due to missing flush.

 * Fixes i830_uxa_put_image for the following issues:

      Bug 28569 - [i965] IGN's flash-based video player crashes X
      https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28569
    
      Bug 28573 - [i965] Fullscreen flash and windowed SDL games fail to
                  update the screen
      https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28573

 * Fix visual corruption of scrollbar in Chromium

 * Fix tiling limits to resolve this issue:

      Bug 28497 - Graphics corruption after opening a specific website
      https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28497

Snapshot 2.11.901 (2010-06-14)
==============================
This is the first release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.12.0 release. We will appreciate any feedback we can get from
testing of this snapshot to improve the 2.12.0 release.

New requirements compared to 2.10
---------------------------------
 * Libdrm >= 2.4.19

Major performance improvements
------------------------------
There have been many performance improvements targeting the
915G/945G/Pineview graphics chipsets (thank to Chris Wilson!). Areas
improved include:

 * Major improvements to glyph rendering

 * Avoid software fallback when using extended desktops, (for example,
   video playback)

 * Better performance when using large windows, (for example with
   firefox scrolling)

 * Avoiding migration ping-pong with gigantic drawing

The following speedups (measured with cairo-perf-trace/cairo-traces)
capture some of the improvements. These were measured on a Pineview
system with a very recent X server, (from git just before 1.8.1). This
compares how this 2.12 release candidate improves performance compared
to 2.11.0:

	Trace			Speedup
	-----			-------
	ocitysmap		5.41x speedup
	firefox-talos-gfx       2.41x speedup
	gnome-terminal-vim      2.15x speedup
	poppler                 1.86x speedup
	firefox-planet-gnome	1.43x speedup
	midori-zoomed		1.39x speedup
	swfdec-giant-steps      1.36x speedup
	xfce4-terminal-a1	1.17x speedup
	evolution		1.09x speedup
	swfdec-youtube		1.06x speedup

Other improvements
------------------
Daniel Vetter improved Xvmc and overlay, adding GEM support.

Bug fixes
---------
There have been many conformance improvements targeting the
915G/945G/Pineview graphics chipsets. The rendercheck test suite
passes once again and there has been a significant reduction in the
number of errors detected by the cairo test suite (notably center
sampling and EXTEND_NONE behaviors are fixed).

Other notable bug fixes include:

 * Fix for bug 28446 Garbled fonts with Mathematica
   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28446

 * Fixes for page-flipping and other DRI2-handling bugs, (Thanks Jesse
   Barnes, and Kristian Høgsberg)

 * Avoid corruption when using extended desktops, (for example, video
   playback)

Release 2.11.0 (2010-03-29)
===========================
New in 2.11: DRI2 and page flipping
-----------------------------------
The most significant new feature of this release is support for new
DRI2 APIs, allowing page flipping to occur for swaps that are
full-screen and not rotated.

Performance improvements in 2.11 compared to 2.10
-------------------------------------------------
Dramatically improved performance of large pixmaps on
memory-constrained hardware, (such as 945), by using tiling.
Note that this fix is new since the most recent release
candidate for this release (2.10.903).

    https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25375

Elimination of software fallback with alpha-only pixmap (a fix which
eliminated a full second from the Moblin boot time):

    https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26189

Notable bug fixes in 2.11 compared to 2.10
------------------------------------------
Fix for undesired black borders on some images, (caued several
problems with firefox):

    http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17933

And other fixes to provide more conformance with existing
software-rendering, (as measures by the cairo test suite), such as the
sampling location for nearest-neighbor sampling.

Other changes
-------------
Eric Anholt and Daniel Vetter both removed large piles of old and
useless code now that the driver requires kernel modesetting
(KMS). This continues to reduce the mainteance burden of the driver,
making it easier to isolate and fix bugs.

Snapshot 2.10.903 (2010-03-22)
==============================
Some notable bug fixes
----------------------
* Fix unpredictable results in page-flipping code due to access of an
  uninitialized variable.

* Two fixes that address a number of long-outstanding failures in the
  cairo test suite:

    Remove coord-adjust for nearest centre-sampling.

    Fill alpha on xrgb images. Closes:

	Bug 17933 - x8r8g8b8 doesn't sample alpha=0 outside surface bounds
	http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17933

* Fix a regression introduced in 2.10.902:

    Fatal server error:
    i915_emit_composite_setup: ADVANCE_BATCH:
    under-used allocation 100/104

	Bug 21723 [i915 bisected] rendering makes X crash
	http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=27123

Other minor fixes (avoid trying to print an error message with a freed
string, set a variable to NULL after freeing), and documentation
updates are also included.

Snapshot 2.10.902 (2010-03-15)
==============================
Some significant bug fixes
--------------------------
Fix video color problems due to YUV plane ordering issue. This fixed a
regression that showed up recently (only in these release candidates).

Fix recent regression leading to corruption under compiz:

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26814

Further DRI2 improvements/fixes from Mario Kleiner and Jesse Barnes,
(including support for SwapBuffers request with divisor != 0).

Fix build against X server 1.6 branch.

Avoid flooding logs after an error occurs.

And dramatic code cleanups
--------------------------
Eric Anholt removed several cases of old, useless code, (conditions
that could not occur now that we require KMS, etc.).

Daniel Vetter eliminated piles of code by modernizing the XvMC
memory-management and completely removing the old i830_memory
allocator (i830_allocate_memory, i830_free_memory), etc.

Snapshot 2.10.901 (2010-02-26)
==============================
The most significant new feature of this release is support for new
DRI2 APIs, allowing page flipping to occur for swaps that are
full-screen and not rotated.

Some significant bug fixes
--------------------------
* Avoid fallback due to failing to extract pixel value from an
  alpha-only solid, (this fix eliminated 1 second from Mobilin boot
  time).

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26189

* Handle full-height blits without tearing in CopyRegion

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22475

Several other fixes and cleanups are included as well, (including the
removal of stale utility code that is now maintained in the separate
intel-gpu-tools module).

Release 2.10.0 (2010-01-04)
===========================
New requirements of 2.10 compared to 2.9
----------------------------------------
 * Linux kernel with kernel-modesetting (KMS)

   All user-modesetting code has now been removed from the driver.
   We highly recommend kernel version 2.6.32 or later.

 * Libdrm >= 2.4.16

New features in 2.10 compared to 2.9
------------------------------------
 * New driver debugging options available in xorg.conf
   (DebugFlushBatches, DebugFlushCaches, DebugWait). See "man intel"
   for more details.

 * Video overlay support with KMS. This currently requires Linux
   2.6.33, but a backport to 2.6.32 is available here:

   http://gitorious.org/daniel-s-linux-stuff/linux-kernel/commits/intel-kms-overlay-for-2.6.32

Notable fixes in 2.10 compared to 2.9
-----------------------------------
 * Fix crash when XRenderComposite is called with a -1 value for
   width/height, (crash at login when using compiz).

   http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24724

 * Fix to support larger extended desktops, (such as a 2560x1600 plus a
   1920x1200 monitor).


 * Fix glyph corruption due to insufficient cache flushing:

   https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24315

Several other correctness and performance fixes are also included.

Note: The driver code of the 2.10.0 release is identical to that of
the 2.9.99.901 release candidate. The only changes in 2.10.0 compared
to 2.9.99.902 are a minor change to the configure script, and some
small updates to the documentation.

Snapshot 2.9.99.902 (2009-12-10)
================================
This is the second release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.10.0 release. We will appreciate any feedback we can get from
testing of this snapshot to improve the 2.10.0 release.

Compared to the previous snapshot, this snapshot now correctly
verifies that libdrm 2.4.16 (or newer) is available. The previous
snapshot also required libdrm 2.4.16 for correct functionality, but
neglected to notify the user of this at configure, compile, or install
time and would instead simply fail to run.

Snapshot 2.9.99.901 (2009-11-30)
================================
This is the first release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.10.0 release. We will appreciate any feedback we can get from
testing of this snapshot to improve the 2.10.0 release.

With this snapshot, the xf86-video-intel driver requires kernel
modesetting (KMS) as all of the user modesetting (UMS) support has
been removed from the driver.

Release 2.9.0 (2009-09-28)
==========================
We are pleased to announce the 2.9.0 release of the xf86-video-intel
driver. (If you have been following along at home, this release is
identical to the 2.8.99.902 release candidate other than the version
number).

New features in 2.9 compared to 2.8
-----------------------------------
* Support for the B43 chipset.

Major fixes in 2.9.0 compared to 2.8.0
--------------------------------------
* Multiple fixes to make the driver stable for 8xx chipsets, (855GM,
  865G, etc.). The 2.8 driver series was extremely unstable with many
  of these chipsets.

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22904 (and many duplicates)
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22947

* Add support for BACKLIGHT property when using kernel modesetting
  (KMS). This allows backlight adjustment with programs such as
  "xbacklight -set <percentage>" or "xrandr --set BACKLIGHT <value>".

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20963

* Fix so that "xrandr --scale" works when using KMS.

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22893

* Fix segfaults of X server when logging out.

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20516

* Avoid falling back to software for 1-bit alpha-only masks.

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23184

* Fix pixel sampling position for 8xx chipsets, (fixes some cairo-test
  suite failures).

Snapshot 2.8.99.901 (2009-09-09)
================================
This is the first release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.9.0 release. We will appreciate any feedback we can get from testing
of this snapshot to improve the 2.9.0 release.

See the commit log for changes in this release, and developers, please
provide me summaries for any major features in this release that you
think should appear in NEWS and in the 2.9.0 release notes.

Note: We are still investigating failures with 865G chipsets, (these
failures existed in the 2.8 series as well). We are hoping to fix
these failures before the 2.9.0 release.

Release 2.8.0 (2009-07-20)
==========================
We are pleased to present this major release of the xf86-video-intel
driver. This release is very similar to the 2.7.99.902 release
candidate but includes a couple of additional bug fixes, (for bugs
#22760 and @22483).

Compared to the 2.7 releases this driver contains several new features
and many bug fixes. The driver now depends on X server 1.6 or later,
and eliminates several obsolete code paths, (XAA and EXA removed in
favor of UXA, DRI1 support eliminated). The driver certainly will work
best with an i915 module from a recent kernel (2.6.31) and with
kernel-modesetting (KMS, specified by loading i915 with the option
"modeset=1").

New features in 2.8.0 compared to 2.7
-------------------------------------
* Remove XAA/EXA/DRI1 and NoAccel, and only support UXA/DRI2 now
  (requiring xserver 1.6).

* VLD support added into XvMC for Mpeg2, which decreases CPU usage
  when playing video.

Major fixes in 2.8.0 compared to 2.7
------------------------------------
* Fix broken front-buffer rendering
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19174

* Fix disabling of XvMC disabled
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20790

* Fix broken VT switch on some machines
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19578

* Improve performance of trapezoid rendering for UXA
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21376

* Vblank sync'd GL buffer swap (fixing video tearing under composite)
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20664

* Fix G41 DRM support
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21095

* Fix crash on some 8xx
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18974

Various fixes for GPU hangs, and more...

Snapshot 2.7.99.902 (2009-07-13)
--------------------------------
This is the first release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.8.0 release. Most major and critical bugs should be fixed, but some
minor bugs may still be present. We will appreciate any feedback we
can get from testing of this snapshot to improve the 2.8.0 release.

Snapshot 2.7.99.901 (2009-06-10)
--------------------------------
This is the first release candidate in preparation for the upcoming
2.8.0 release. Most critical bugs should be fixed, but some major
bugs may still be present. We will appreciate any feedback we can
get from testing of this snapshot to improve the 2.8.0 release.

Some of the major fixes in this snapshot include:

	* Several fixes for intermittent GPU hangs/crashes, (some of
	  which already appeared in the 2.7.1 release)

	* Fix to avoid X crash when viewing large images in browser

	* Fix X server failure when running old (non-GEM) kernel

	* Fixes for SDVO LVDS mode detection

	* Fix major performance regression of trapezoid rendering
          compared to XAA/EXA

	* New support for tear-free video when using KMS

	* New support for tear-free DRI2 CopyRegion

Snapshot 2.7.99.1 (2009-04-28)
------------------------------
This is a development snapshot very early in the process toward
developing 2.8. There have been some big changes to the code, and
we're anxious to get feedback on these changes as early as possible.

Here is a summary of the biggest changes:

  * Driver now depends on X server 1.6 or later

  * Eliminate XAA and EXA support (in favor of UXA)

  * Eliminate DRI1 support

  * Fixes for running without DRI at all

These code removals represent a deletion of a substantial amount of
code, (and hopefully piles of bugs), as well as reduce the maintenance
effort going forward as the number of combinatorial configurations for
the driver are greatly reduced. This means that users are much more
likely to be running code that has actually been tested, and it will
be much easy for developers to replicate bugs that users experience.

One of the things that would be most useful in testing this release is
to revisit any outstanding bugs that you have previously reported. If
the buggy behavior is gone, (or the bug is no longer relevant---such
as a bug that's specific to XAA only), please feel free to indicate so
in bugzilla or even just close the bug.

If you confirm that the bug is still present, please indicate so in
the bug report. (I was going to ask that you select a 1.7.99 version,
but it looks like bugzilla only has versions for products not
compoenents, while we use a "xorg" product and a "driver/intel"
component.) We definitely want to make any such confirmed bugs a
priority, so it would be nice to have a consistent mechanism to search
for these bugs. Suggestions are welcome on the best approach.

Thanks in advance for any testing or feedback on this snapshot.

Release 2.7.0 (2009-04-15)
--------------------------
Compared to the 2.6 series, 2.7.0 has a large number of bug fixes, but
also a few significant features, such as:

        SDVO-TV support, available on ADD2 card (bug#9992) and
        D945GCLF2 board (bug#17776).

        Basic SDVO-LVDS support

        XV video display without tearing
	[Though this isn't working for all users yet, see
	https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21076 ]

	Various fixes for UXA, DRI2, and Kernel modesetting.

We encourage users to use kernel modesetting and UXA acceleration with
this release, which should give the best performance and
robustness. When KMS is available, UXA is the default acceleration
used by the driver, (EXA is the default otherwise).

Known issue:

	Some Linux kernel versions (such as 2.6.29) are known to have
	broken PAT code that causes recent versions of this driver to
	fail, (which can manifest as the X server simply not
	starting). This can be verified by adding the "nopat" option
	to the kernel command-line and seeing the failure go away. We
	hope that newer kernels in the 2.6.29.x as well as 2.6.30 and
	above will have working PAT code.

Some of the most notable bugs fixed in 2.7.0 include:
