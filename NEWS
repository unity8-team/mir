Release 2.7.0 (2009-04-15)
--------------------------
Compared to the 2.6 series, 2.7.0 has a large number of bug fixes, but
also a few significant features, such as:

        SDVO-TV support, available on ADD2 card (bug#9992) and
        D945GCLF2 board (bug#17776).

        Basic SDVO-LVDS support

        XV video display without tearing
	[Though this isn't working for all users yet, see
	https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21076 ]

	Various fixes for UXA, DRI2, and Kernel modesetting.

We encourage users to use kernel modesetting and UXA acceleration with
this release, which should give the best performance and
robustness. When KMS is available, UXA is the default acceleration
used by the driver, (EXA is the default otherwise).

Known issue:

	Some Linux kernel versions (such as 2.6.29) are known to have
	broken PAT code that causes recent versions of this driver to
	fail, (which can manifest as the X server simply not
	starting). This can be verified by adding the "nopat" option
	to the kernel command-line and seeing the failure go away. We
	hope that newer kernels in the 2.6.29.x as well as 2.6.30 and
	above will have working PAT code.
