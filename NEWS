Snapshot 2.7.99.1 (2009-04-28)
------------------------------
This is a development snapshot very early in the process toward
developing 2.8. There have been some big changes to the code, and
we're anxious to get feedback on these changes as early as possible.

Here is a summary of the biggest changes:

  * Driver now depends on X server 1.6 or later

  * Eliminate XAA and EXA support (in favor of UXA)

  * Eliminate DRI1 support

  * Fixes for running without DRI at all

These code removals represent a deletion of a substantial amount of
code, (and hopefully piles of bugs), as well as reduce the maintenance
effort going forward as the number of combinatorial configurations for
the driver are greatly reduced. This means that users are much more
likely to be running code that has actually been tested, and it will
be much easy for developers to replicate bugs that users experience.

One of the things that would be most useful in testing this release is
to revisit any outstanding bugs that you have previously reported. If
the buggy behavior is gone, (or the bug is no longer relevant---such
as a bug that's specific to XAA only), please feel free to indicate so
in bugzilla or even just close the bug.

If you confirm that the bug is still present, please indicate so in
the bug report. (I was going to ask that you select a 1.7.99 version,
but it looks like bugzilla only has versions for products not
compoenents, while we use a "xorg" product and a "driver/intel"
component.) We definitely want to make any such confirmed bugs a
priority, so it would be nice to have a consistent mechanism to search
for these bugs. Suggestions are welcome on the best approach.

Thanks in advance for any testing or feedback on this snapshot.

Release 2.7.0 (2009-04-15)
--------------------------
Compared to the 2.6 series, 2.7.0 has a large number of bug fixes, but
also a few significant features, such as:

        SDVO-TV support, available on ADD2 card (bug#9992) and
        D945GCLF2 board (bug#17776).

        Basic SDVO-LVDS support

        XV video display without tearing
	[Though this isn't working for all users yet, see
	https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21076 ]

	Various fixes for UXA, DRI2, and Kernel modesetting.

We encourage users to use kernel modesetting and UXA acceleration with
this release, which should give the best performance and
robustness. When KMS is available, UXA is the default acceleration
used by the driver, (EXA is the default otherwise).

Known issue:

	Some Linux kernel versions (such as 2.6.29) are known to have
	broken PAT code that causes recent versions of this driver to
	fail, (which can manifest as the X server simply not
	starting). This can be verified by adding the "nopat" option
	to the kernel command-line and seeing the failure go away. We
	hope that newer kernels in the 2.6.29.x as well as 2.6.30 and
	above will have working PAT code.

Some of the most notable bugs fixed in 2.7.0 include:
