<H1>Mesa 7.1 Release Notes / May XX, 2008</H1>

<p>
Mesa 7.1 is a new development release.
There have been many internal code changes since Mesa 7.0.x.
It should be relatively stable, but those who are especially concerned about
stability should wait for Mesa 7.2.
</p>


<h2>MD5 checksums</h2>
<pre>
TBD
</pre>


<h2>New features</h2>
<ul>
<li>autoconf-based configuration (and clean-up of Makefiles)
<li>Reduced dependencies between X server and Mesa
<li>GL_EXT_texture_from_pixmap extension for Xlib driver
<li>Support for the GL shading language with i965 driver (implemented by Intel)
</ul>


<h2>To Do (someday) items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remove the MEMCPY() and _mesa_memcpy() wrappers and just use memcpy().
Probably do the same for malloc, calloc, etc.
The wrappers were useful in the past for memory debugging but now we
have valgrind.  Not worried about SunOS 4 support anymore either...
<li>Switch to freeglut
<li>Fix linux-glide target/driver.
<li>Improved lambda and derivative calculation for frag progs.
</ul>
