<H1>Mesa 7.6 Release Notes / date TBD</H1>

<p>
Mesa 7.6 is a new development release.
People who are concerned with stability and reliability should stick
with a previous release or wait for Mesa 7.6.1.
</p>
<p>
Mesa 7.6 implements the OpenGL 2.1 API, but the version reported by
glGetString(GL_VERSION) depends on the particular driver being used.
Some drivers don't support all the features required in OpenGL 2.1.
</p>
<p>
See the <a href="install.html">Compiling/Installing page</a> for prerequisites
for DRI hardware acceleration.
</p>
<p>
Note that the Mesa project is no longer using odd/even version numbers
to indicate development/stable releases.
The so-called development releases have been fairly stable.
If you're especially concerned with stability you should probably look for
"point" releases such as 7.5.1 which will be a bug-fix release.
