// This file provides a custom implementation for the UI_GET_SYSNAME ioctl
// request. Although libevent-uinput provides a fallback for platforms missing
// this ioctl, the fallback doesn't work well with some of our ARM devices. In
// particular, the fallback chooses the virtual device by checking for
// devices that were created while we were creating the device, like:
//
// a = now
// create device
// b = now
// ...
// if (a <= device_creation_time <= b) choose device
//
// This is reasonable, but on some devices, for unknown reasons, the creation
// time of the virtual device occasionally falls a bit before this interval.
//
// The custom implementation provided in this file uses similar logic but it's
// less strict in its timing requirements. It chooses the first device it finds
// that was created at most 2 seconds ago.
//
// Note that both approaches are racy in real conditions (e.g. other devices
// could have been created while we are creating our device, hence the need for
// the UI_GET_SYSNAME ioctl), but they are work reasonably well in a controlled
// testing environment.
