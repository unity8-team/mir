Binary Test Data
================

This directory contains files for testing our shared library loading code.

The lib$ARCH.so files are minimal valid ELF objects of the appropriate architectures,
generated by running (on the relevant architecture, ARCH):

  * touch foo.cpp
  * gcc -o lib$ARCH.so -shared foo.cpp

These binary objects are then stored in bzr.
