Welcome to Mir {#mainpage}
==============

Mir is a next generation display server targeted as a replacement for the X
window server system to unlock next-generation user experiences for devices
ranging from Linux desktop to mobile devices powered by Ubuntu. The primary
purpose of Mir is to enable the development of the next generation
[Unity](http://unity.ubuntu.com).

More detailed information about the motivation, scope, and high-level design
of Mir can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/MirSpec .

Getting and installing Mir
--------------------------

### Using pre-built packages

If you just want to try out mir, or write client applications, then the easiest
way is to use the pre-built packages:

 - \ref installing_prebuilt_on_pc
 - \ref installing_prebuilt_on_android

### Building and installing from source

If you are curious about Mir internals or intend to contribute to it, you should
get the source and build it:

 - \ref building_source_for_pc
 - \ref building_source_for_arm

### Preparing a VM to run Mir

Especially if you want to debug the shell without locking your system this might be a helpful setup:

- \ref setup_kvm_for_mir

Getting involved
----------------

The best place to ask questions and discuss about the Mir project is the
#ubuntu-mir IRC channel on freenode.

The Mir project is hosted on Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/mir

Currently, the Mir code activity is performed on a development branch:
lp:~mir-team/mir/development-branch

Approximately fortnightly, this development branch is promoted to the branch
used for the ubuntu archive and touch images. Please submit any merge proposals 
against the development branch.

Please file bug reports at: https://bugs.launchpad.net/mir

The Mir development mailing list can be found at: https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/Mir-devel

The Mir coding guidelines are [here](cppguide/index.html).
