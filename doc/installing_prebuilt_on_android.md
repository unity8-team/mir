Mir has been used on an array of devices powered by the factory-provided 
android drivers. Mir currently supports the fb module and the hwc module
up to version 1.3. If you encounter a problem with your device, please
file a bug and we'll see if we can help.

Installing Mir

Mir should be installed and used by default on Ubuntu Touch images. Mir is 
available in the Ubuntu archive. Ensure that the android platform drivers,
available in the mir-graphics-drivers-android metapackage, are installed for
an android-based device.
