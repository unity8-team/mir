     * complete while ensuring that swapper keeps functioning properly.
     *
     * Note that it's not always possible to force a request to complete
     * without breaking the swapper. It's a logic error to attempt to call
     * this method if the circumstances don't allow a forced completion.
     *
     * To successfully use this method you should ensure that (i.e. the
     * preconditions for calling this method are):
     *
     * - The compositor is not holding any buffers (e.g., it has been stopped).
     * - The client is trying to acquire at most one buffer at a time (which is
     *   normal usage, and enforced by the high level API).
