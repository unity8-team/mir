     *                     will get the same buffer returned. This ensures that
     *                     a surface visible on multiple outputs does not get
     *                     its buffers consumed any faster than the refresh
     *                     rate of a single monitor. Implementations may ignore
     *                     the value of frameno on single-monitor platforms
     *                     only. The caller should always ensure the frameno
     *                     is different to the previous frame. The exact value
     *                     of frameno is not important but a large range of
     *                     values is recommended.
