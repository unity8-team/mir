/**
 * \brief A source of moderately-difficult-to-spoof cookies.
 *
 * The primary motivation for this is to provide event timestamps that clients find it difficult to spoof.
 * This is useful for focus grant and similar operations where shell behaviour should be dependent on
 * the timestamp of the client event that caused the request.
 *
 * Some spoofing protection is desirable; experience with X clients shows that they will go to some effort
 * to attempt to bypass focus stealing prevention.
 *
 * This is not in any way cryptographically secure. This DOES NOT provide security.
